The first half of the Notenik display shows all the Notes in your current Collection as a simple list, initially sorted by Title. 

You can navigate through this list using some of the buttons on the Toolbar:

<ul>
<li>The home button takes you to the first note, at the top of the list. </li>
<li>&lt;&nbsp; Takes you to the prior note.</li>
<li>&gt;&nbsp; Takes you to the next note. </li>
</ul>

Some of the same navigational commands are available under the Note menu, with handy keyboard shortcuts noted on the right. There you will also find a command to scroll the list so as to bring the currently selected Note into view.
