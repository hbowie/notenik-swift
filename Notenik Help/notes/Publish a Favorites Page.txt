As mentioned above, you may wish to use Notenik to keep track of your Web Bookarks. If so, you can Tag your favorite bookmarks with the tag 'Favorite', then publish all of your Favorite Bookmarks as a single Web page that you can then set as your home page within your Web browser. 

The Notenik Favorites page is designed to display your most important bookmarks on a single page, in a series of rows and columns. These links are grouped by the 'Favorites' sub-categories specified. 

Use the Favorites tab on the Notenik preferences to specify the number of columns to appear, and the maximum number of rows to include in a single column.

See this [Favorites Sampler](http://www.notenik.com/favorites/favorites.html) for an example of what a Favorites page might look like.
