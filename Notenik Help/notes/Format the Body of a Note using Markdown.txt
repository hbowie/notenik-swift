[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a simple syntax for formatting plain text files so that they can be easily read and written by humans, but also can easily be converted into HTML for use on the Web. If you'd like, you can use the Markdown syntax for formatting the body of each note. But it's not required. 

When you view a Note on the Display tab, you will see the Body Field Value converted to HTML using a Markdown parser. If you haven't used any special Markdown formatting, then the text will simply appear as you entered it. 

In fact, there is an option under the Note menu to generate HTML from the Body of a Note, and to either copy it to your system clipboard, in preparation for pasting the HTML somewhere else, or to store it in a file. You can even specify a preferred HTML folder for each of your Collections, in your Collection Preferences.

Notenik uses the [Flexmark](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java) parser to convert from Markdown to HTML, and includes the Typographic, Tables and Definitions extensions.
