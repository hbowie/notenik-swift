Body:   
 
Add a Code field to a Collection in order to store a code snippet as part of each Note in that Collection. 

The code block you enter in a Code field will be formatted on the Display tab enclosed in pre and code tags, so that line breaks will be honored, and the code will be displayed using a monospaced font. 

You may use the Copy Code command on the Note menu to copy the code block for a selected Note to the System Clipboard.
