The Reports menu allows you to select from a list of reports, and then generate the report of your choice. Reports are generally HTML web pages generated from [PSTextMerge](http://www.powersurgepub.com/products/pstextmerge/user-guide.html) scripts.

Any number of report scripts and templates may be placed within a folder named 'reports' that appears inside each folder of notes.

If a 'reports' folder has not yet been created and populated for a particular Collection, then a set of standard reports will be loaded from the application's resources folder.

Reports are generally a simpler and more straightforward alternative to the Publish function described below.
