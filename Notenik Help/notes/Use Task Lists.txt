You may find at times that you have a series of steps you follow repeatedly for each new work item. 

For example, if you're a blogger, then for each new blog post you might:

* Write the post
* Publish the post
* Promote the post on social media

In a case like this, you can create a list of tasks, and then add the entire list to a Collection each time you have a new work item (such as a blog post) that you want to track. 

Here's what you need to do. You can find all the special List functions under the Lists menu. 

1. Create the Collection for which you wish to use one or more Task Lists. 

2. Make sure the Collection has whatever fields you need defined in the Collection's template. 

3. Under the Lists menu, select New List to create a new List to be used for that Collection. 

4. Once you have a List created, use the Open List menu item to use Notenik to edit the List's contents. 

5. Once you're done editing a list, you can use the Return from List menu item to return to the original Collection. 

6. When you're ready to add a List to your Collection, select the Add List menu item. 

Note that each list will be stored within the Collection's folder, as sub-folders within a 'lists' folder. In addition to using Notenik to create and update these list items you can, of course, use your favorite text editor. 

Pay special attention to the following fields when creating List items. 

- Format the Title field anticipating that it will be appended to the name of each new work item. 

- Start the Sequence field with 'a.', varying the number after the period to indicate the desired sequence of steps in the list. 

- Instead of entering a date in the Date field, enter a positive number to indicate the number of days after the first step that this step should be scheduled for. Enter '+0' for the first step and any others to be performed on the same day.
