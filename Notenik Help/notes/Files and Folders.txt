Each Collection is stored within its own folder. You may store each Collection wherever you like. You may wish to store one or more of your Collections in a special folder used by a syncing service such as iCloud or Dropbox, in which case your Collection will be synced just like any other files and folders managed by that service. 

Within each Collection folder you will find one file for each Note in the Collection, with the file name based closely on the Note's title. 

In addition to the Note files, the following special files and folders may be found within a Collection folder. 

Each Collection folder will contain a special file named '- INFO.nnk'. This is a plain text file, in Notenik format, containing some handy metadata about the Collection, such as the last sort sequence set for it, and the key of the last Note selected. If you sync a Collection to other devices using a service such as iCloud or Dropbox, then this metadata will be synced as well. 

Each Collection folder will also contain a special file named '- README.txt'. This file simply identifies the folder as a Notenik Collection. 

A Collection folder may contain a subfolder named 'files', containing any attachments for Notes within the Collection. 

A Collection folder may contain a subfolder named 'reports', containing files used to generate one or more reports from the Notes in the Collection.
