Each Note is part of a Collection, and each Collection is stored in its own folder (aka directory). Each Note within a Collection must have its own unique Title. 

You can organize your Notes into as many Collections as you would like, and store each Collection wherever you would like. 

Note that commands on the File menu generally refer to Collection folders, and not to individual Note files within a folder. 

The Notenik application can open multiple Collections at a time, each within its own window. 

The Open Recent command on the File menu allows you to easily open any collection that you've recently accessed. 

The Save As command on the File menu allows you to save a currently open collection to a new location (and optionally move the folder at the old location to the trash). 

You may wish to identify one of your Collections as your Essential Collection. If you have identified an Essential Collection, then this will be the first Collection opened by default when you launch the application. Once you have your desired Collection open, just select the 'Make this Collection Essential' command from the File menu to designate that Collection as your Essential Collection. 

You might want to use the New command on the File menu to create your first Collection now, if you don't already have one created. 

Note that, when creating a New Collection, you will be presented with a standard Open/Save dialog. Within this dialog, you will need to take four separate actions:

1. Navigate to the desired parent folder (if you're not already there);

2. Click on the 'New Folder' button and give the new Collection folder a name;

3. Select the folder you just created (if it's not already selected);

4. Click the 'Open' button to finish initialization and opening of the new Collection.
