Notenik's application Preferences allow you to adjust its appearance and functionality in a number of ways. 

The Application Preferences can be found under the Options menu. 

The Display tab in the Notenik preferences allows you to change the font, font size, and foreground and background colors used for the Display of each Note.

The Notenik General preferences contain a number of options for modifying the program's look and feel. Feel free to experiment with these to find your favorite configuration. Some options may require you to quit and re-launch Notenik before the changes will take effect.

**SplitPane: Horizontal Split?**: Check the box to have the **List** and **Tags** appear on the left of the main screen, rather than the top.

**Deletion: Confirm Deletes?**: Check the box to have a confirmation dialog shown whenever you attempt to delete the selected Note.

**Software Updates: Check Automatically?**: Check the box to have Notenik check for newer versions whenever it launches.

**Check Now**: Click this button to check for a new version immediately.
