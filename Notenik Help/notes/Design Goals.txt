It may help you to better appreciate Notenik once you understand the design goals for the app. 

1. Help a user to maintain and easily access small bits of information in the form of notes. 

2. Keep things simple and flexible.  

3. Store notes in an open, non-proprietary format that humans can easily write, read and understand, but also in a format that can be usefully manipulated by a number of software tools. 

4. Notes should be portable, easily moved from one device to another, from one platform to another, without losing anything in the process.   

5. Notes should be durable, able to survive the disappearance of any single piece of software or service.  

6. Some basic software for working with notes should be free and open-source. 

7. It should be possible to organize notes in a variety of useful ways. 

8. It should be possible to usefully extend this basic idea of a note in as many ways as possible, without compromising any of the design goals above. 

9. We want to do all of this through a single, simple, sturdy user interface. 

Sound good? If so, then we're ready to move on.
