<h1>
View Your Notes as a List
</h1>
<p>The first half of the Notenik display shows all the Notes in your current Collection as a simple list, initially sorted by Title.
You can navigate through this list using some of the buttons on the Toolbar:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Home button takes you to the first Note.</li>
<li>‘&lt;’ Takes you to the prior note.</li>
<li>‘&gt;’ Takes you to the next note.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the same navigational commands are available under the Note menu, with handy keyboard shortcuts noted on the right. There you will also find a command to scroll the list so as to bring the currently selected Note into view at the top of the displayed Notes.</p>
