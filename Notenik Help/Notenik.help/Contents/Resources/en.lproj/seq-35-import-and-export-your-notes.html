<h1>
	Import and Export Your Notes
</h1>
<p>You can import and export a Collection in a variety of formats, using commands found under the File menu.
Following are the supported formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Import/Export in Notenik Format</p>
<p>You can import and export your Notes in the current collection from/to a folder in the same Notenik format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import/Export in Tab-Delimited Format</p>
<p>Each Note will be represented as one row/line, and each field will be represented in a separate column. Tabs are used to separate columns. This format is suitable for import into MS Excel, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import/Export in CSV Format</p>
<p>Each Note will be represented as one row/line, and each field will be represented in a separate column. Commas are used to separate columns. This format is suitable for import into MS Excel, for example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the File menu also contains a command to Split Tags. This will result in a special export in which each Note may be written multiple times, once for each Tag in the Note&rsquo;s Tags field. Notes without any Tags will be written only once, with a blank Tag field. In other cases, the Tag field will contain a single Tag, even if the Tags field contains multiple Tags.</p>
