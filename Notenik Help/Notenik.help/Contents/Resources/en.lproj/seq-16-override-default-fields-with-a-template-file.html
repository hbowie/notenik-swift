	Override Default Fields with a Template file
</h1>
<p>By default, Notenik shows only four Fields for a Note: Title, Link, Tags and Body. However, this default may be altered by placing a file named &lsquo;template.txt&rsquo; or &lsquo;template.md&rsquo; within a Collection&rsquo;s folder. Such a file should be in the normal Notenik format, although the Field Labels specified need not have any accompanying values. When such a template file is found, the field names found in this file will be used as the fields to be displayed and maintained for that Collection, overriding the default four.</p>
<p>If you are using a field other than one of the Notenik standard fields described elsewhere in this document, then you may specify the type of field desired by placing a special value within a pair of less-than greater-than signs, following the field name and the delimiting colon.</p>
<p>Here are the currently recognized values:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;3&gt; - A long text field, with multiple lines for data entry. 
&lt;builder&gt; - A long text field, with multiple lines for data entry. 
&lt;longtext&gt; - A long text field, with multiple lines for data entry. 
</code></pre>
<p>You may use the Collection Template command on the Collection menu to modify the template for the current Collection. Just put a check mark next to whichever fields you&rsquo;d like to use for that particular Collection. Then click on the Save Template button to save your template with the indicated fields.</p>
<p>You can also use any text editor to modify the sample template file to reflect the fields you desire for that Collection.</p>
<p>When creating a new Collection, you will be presented with the Collection Template window automatically, to give you a chance to customize the fields to be used for that new Collection.</p>
<p>The file extension used for the template file will be used as the file extension for Notes subsequently created within the Collection.</p>
