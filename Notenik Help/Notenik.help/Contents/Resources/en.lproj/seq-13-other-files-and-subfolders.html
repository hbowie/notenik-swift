	Other Files and Subfolders
</h1>
<p>Within each Collection folder you will find one file for each Note in the Collection, with the file name based closely on the Note’s title.</p>
<p>In addition to the Note files, the following special files and folders may be found within a Collection folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will contain a special file named ‘- INFO.nnk’. This is a plain text file, in Notenik format, containing some handy metadata about the Collection, such as the last sort sequence set for it. If you sync a Collection to other devices using a service such as iCloud or Dropbox, then this metadata will be synced as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will also contain a special file named ‘- README.txt’. This file simply identifies the folder as a Notenik Collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will normally also contain a ‘template.txt’ or ‘template.md’ file identifying the fields used within the Collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ‘files’ folder will contain any Attachments for the Collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a ‘mirror’ folder will contain templates, scripts and css used to mirror the collection to an alternate format (such as HTML).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ‘reports’ sub-folder may contain a number of Template files and/or Script files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
