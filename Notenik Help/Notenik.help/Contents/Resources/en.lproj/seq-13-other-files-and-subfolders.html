Other Files and Subfolders

<!-- Markdown to HTML conversion provided by NotenikMkdown -->
<p>Within each Collection folder you will find one file for each Note in the Collection, with the file name based closely on the Note's title. </p>
<p>In addition to the Note files, the following special files and folders may be found within a Collection folder. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will contain a special file named &#8216;- INFO.nnk&#8217;. This is a plain text file, in Notenik format, containing some handy metadata about the Collection, such as the last sort sequence set for it. If you sync a Collection to other devices using a service such as iCloud or Dropbox, then this metadata will be synced as well. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will also contain a special file named &#8216;- README.txt&#8217;. This file simply identifies the folder as a Notenik Collection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Collection folder will normally also contain a &#8216;template.txt&#8217; or &#8216;template.md&#8217; file identifying the fields used within the Collection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A &#8216;files&#8217; folder will contain any Attachments for the Collection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a &#8216;mirror&#8217; folder will contain templates, scripts and css used to mirror the collection to an alternate format (such as HTML). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A &#8216;reports&#8217; sub-folder may contain a number of Template files and/or Script files. </p>
</li>
</ul>
