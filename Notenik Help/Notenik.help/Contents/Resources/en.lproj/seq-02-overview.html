Overview
</h1>
<p>Notenik, as you might imagine, is an application you can use to record and manage your notes. It's free and <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/notenik-swift">open-source</a>, and is available from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>. </p>
<p>A Note can contain whatever bits of textual information might interest you, and you can store your Notes in as many separate Collections as you would like. </p>
<p>Each Note is stored in its own text file, and each Collection consists of a folder full of Notes. Collections can be stored wherever you would like. Collections can be synced to the cloud, and/or to other devices, using services such as Dropbox and iCloud. You can use any text editor, on any platform, to view and edit your Notes. Notenik formats each text file in a simple, straightforward way that is easily read by humans. </p>
<p>Each Note always has a Title and a Body, but other fields are often added. A Tags field is generally present, and a Link field is also common. Alongside of a simple list of the Notes in a Collection, Notenik always displays an additional outline view, showing the same Notes organized by their Tags. </p>
<p>Notenik offers multiple ways to get Note data out of Notenik and into various alternate formats. These transformation functions include a special templating language, and a special scripting language. </p>
<p>Note that this documentation describes the latest version of the Notenik application, written in Swift, and not the earlier version, written in Java. </p>
