<h1>
	Notes are Collected into Folders
</h1>
<p>Each Note is part of a Collection, and each Collection is stored in its own folder (aka directory). Each Note within a Collection must have its own unique Title.</p>
<p>You can organize your Notes into as many Collections as you would like, and store each Collection wherever you would like.</p>
<p>The Notenik application can open multiple Collections at a time, each in its own window. The Open Recent command under the File menu provides easy access to recently opened Collections.</p>
<p>You may use a command under the File menu to designate the current Collection as your Essential Collection. Once identified, this will be the first Collection opened each time the application launches.</p>
<p>The Save As command under the File menu allows you to save an entire Collection in a new location, with the option to either keep the current location (effectively making a copy) or to delete it (effectively moving the Collection to a new location).</p>
<p>You might want to use the New command on the File menu to create your first Collection now, if you don&rsquo;t already have one created.</p>
