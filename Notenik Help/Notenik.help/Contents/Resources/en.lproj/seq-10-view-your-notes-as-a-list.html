<h1>
	View Your Notes as a List
</h1>
<p>The first half of the Notenik display shows all the Notes in your current Collection as a simple list, sorted by Title.</p>
<p>You can navigate through this list using some of the buttons on the Toolbar:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;&lt; Takes you to the first Note.</li>
<li>&gt;&gt; Takes you to the last note. </li>
<li>&lt;&nbsp; Takes you to the prior note.</li>
<li>&gt;&nbsp; Takes you to the next note. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the same navigational commands are available under the Note menu, with handy keyboard shortcuts noted on the right. There you will also find a command to scroll the list so as to bring the currently selected Note into view at the top of the displayed Notes.</p>
<p>Feel free to use the Notenik General Preferences to change the Notenik display from a horizontal split to a vertical split, or vice-versa. Sometimes it&rsquo;s more useful to have the list of Notes on the left, while at other times it may be more useful to have it appear at the top of the window.</p>
