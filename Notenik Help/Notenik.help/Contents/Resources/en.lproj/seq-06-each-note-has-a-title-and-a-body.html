<h1>
Each Note has a Title and a Body
</h1>
<p>In its most basic form, a Note consists of a Title and a Body.</p>
<p>A Title consists of a few words telling you what the Note is about.</p>
<p>The Body consists of the text of the Note, containing as many words as you like.</p>
<p>If no Title is specified within a Note file, then the file name (without the extension) will be used as the Title of the Note.</p>
