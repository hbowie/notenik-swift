	Help Using Notenik
</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;re already reading this intro, so obviously I don&rsquo;t need to tell you how to find this.
But here&rsquo;s a few other help items that are available, including some that may not be so obvious.</p>
<p>This User Guide is available as a web page from the <a href="http://www.notenik.net">Notenik</a> site and from the Notenik Help Menu.</p>
<p>But the same content is also available as a Collection of Help Notes, by selecting the corresponding Open Command from Notenik&rsquo;s Help menu. You may find it a little easier to read and navigate in this form, plus you can practice using Notenik as you read the Intro!</p>
