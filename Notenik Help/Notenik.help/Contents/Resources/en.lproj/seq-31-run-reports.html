	Run Reports
</h1>
<p>The Reports menu allows you to select from a list of reports, and then generate the report of your choice. Reports are generally HTML web pages generated from <a href="http://www.powersurgepub.com/products/pstextmerge/user-guide.html">PSTextMerge</a> scripts.</p>
<p>Any number of report scripts and templates may be placed within a folder named &lsquo;reports&rsquo; that appears inside each folder of notes.</p>
<p>If a &lsquo;reports&rsquo; folder has not yet been created and populated for a particular Collection, then a set of standard reports will be loaded from the application&rsquo;s resources folder.</p>
<p>Reports are generally a simpler and more straightforward alternative to the Publish function described below.</p>
