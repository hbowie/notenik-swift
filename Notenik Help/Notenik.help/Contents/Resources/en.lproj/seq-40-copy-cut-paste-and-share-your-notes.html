<h1>
Copy, Cut, Paste and Share your Notes
</h1>
<p>There are several different actions you can perform with individual notes. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy - Use the Copy command beneath the Edit menu to copy the currently selected Note to the system clipboard. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut - Use the Cut command beneath the Edit menu to copy the currently selected Note to the system clipboard, and then delete the selected Note. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paste - Use the Paste command beneath the Edit menu to paste a copied or cut Note into the same or a different Collection (or into an email, or any other destination capable of receiving text). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate - Use the Duplicate Note command beneath the Note menu to duplicate the currently selected Note within the same Collection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share menu command - Use the Share command beneath the Note menu to share the contents of the selected Note with several different options: share the Note's body only, or the entire Note; share in plain text format, or in Markdown format, or as a Markdown blockquote, or as an HTML fragment or as an entire HTML document; and copy the result to the system clipboard, or write the result to an output text file. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share via Toolbar - Use the Share command on the Toolbar to send an entire Note to any of several different destinations (Mail, Message, etc.) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag and Drop - When two Collections are open, the user may drag a Note from the List view of one Collection to the List view of a second Collection and Drop it there. The Note will be added to the second Collection, and will still remain in its original Collection. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that the user should be on the Display Tab, and not the Edit tab, in order to perform cut/copy/paste functions since, when on the Edit tab, cut/copy/paste will typically apply to the text within a field, and not to the entire note. </p>
<p>Also be aware that Note Attachments will not be copied or pasted. </p>
<p>When copying notes from one Collection to another, any fields present in the first Collection but not in the second will be dropped. </p>
