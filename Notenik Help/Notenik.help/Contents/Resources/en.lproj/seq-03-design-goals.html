	Design Goals
</h1>
<p>It may help you to better appreciate Notenik once you understand the design goals for the app.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Help a user to maintain and easily access small bits of information in the form of notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep things simple and flexible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store notes in an open, non-proprietary format that humans can easily write, read and understand, but also in a format that can be usefully manipulated by a number of software tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notes should be portable, easily moved from one device to another, from one platform to another, without losing anything in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notes should be durable, able to survive the disappearance of any single piece of software or service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some basic software for working with notes should be free and open-source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should be possible to organize notes in a variety of useful ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should be possible to usefully extend this basic idea of a note in as many ways as possible, without compromising any of the design goals above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want to do all of this through a single, simple, sturdy user interface.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sound good? If so, then we&rsquo;re ready to move on.</p>
