	Use Other Special Fields
</h1>
<p>You can use whatever Field Labels you want within a Collection, but there are a few other Field Labels that have some special Notenik logic associated with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Author &ndash; The author(s) of the Note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rating &ndash; Your rating of the note, on a scale of one to five.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type &ndash; The type of note. Any values may be used to distinguish between different types of notes within a collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaser &ndash; An excerpt from the note used as a teaser in a list of notes. The teaser may be formatted using Markdown.</p>
</li>
</ul>
