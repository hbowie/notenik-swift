	Favorites to HTML
</h1>
<p>If you have a Collection of Notes representing Web Bookmarks, then you may wish to use the &lsquo;Favorites&rsquo; tag to identify the bookmarks you reference most often. You may then use a sub-tag within the &lsquo;Favorites&rsquo; tag to organize your favorite bookmarks into categories. Once you&rsquo;ve identified your Favorites, then you may use the Favorites to HTML command under the File menu to create a Web page containing all your favorite bookmarks, organized under headings representing the categories you have chosen. Notenik will display your favorites in four columns, with a maximum of 32 lines per column. Assuming a reasonable number of favorite bookmarks, these will typically display all of your favorites within a single Web page on your Mac. You may then wish to identify the resuling page as the homepage within all of your Web browsers (Safari, Chrome, etc.).</p>
