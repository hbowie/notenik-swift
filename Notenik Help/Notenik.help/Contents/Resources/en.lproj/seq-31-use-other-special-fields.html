Use Other Special Fields
</h1>
<p>You can use whatever Field Labels you want within a Collection, but there are a few other Field Labels that have some special Notenik logic associated with them. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Author &#8211; The author(s) of the Note. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rating &#8211; Your rating of the note, on a scale of one to five. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type &#8211; The type of note. Any values may be used to distinguish between different types of notes within a collection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaser &#8211; An excerpt from the note used as a teaser in a list of notes. The teaser may be formatted using Markdown. </p>
</li>
</ul>
