	Motivations
</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start off by explaining my primary motivations behind the creation of Notenik.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I love notes. I like being able to write down some words &ndash; a few or a bunch &ndash; about something that interests me and then refer back to them later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the simplicity and flexibility of notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to store my notes in an open, non-proprietary format that I can easily write, read and understand, but also in a format that can be usefully manipulated by a number of software tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want my notes to be portable. I want to be able to easily move them around from one device to another, from one platform to another, without losing anything in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want my notes to be durable. I don&rsquo;t want to have to worry about  being unable to read them a few years down the road because some piece of software is no longer available or some &ldquo;free&rdquo; service has gone out of business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want some basic application software for working with my notes to be open-source and available on as many platforms as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be able to organize my notes in a variety of useful ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be able to usefully extend this basic idea of a note in as many ways as possible, while still remaining true to all of my motivations above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want a simple, sturdy user interface that I can apply to as much stuff as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing these motivations upfront because, if these same ideas appeal to you, then there&rsquo;s a good chance it will be worth your while to read a bit further. On the other hand, if you have different sorts of interests, then it&rsquo;s probably best to just stop now and go about your business.</p>
