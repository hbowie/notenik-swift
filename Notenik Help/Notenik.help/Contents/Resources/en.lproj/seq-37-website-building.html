Website Building
</h1>
<p>Note that many of the individual Notenik functions described above can be combined in order to build websites. Create a Collection, add appropriate fields, create template files, record a script, and you can easily generate a set of HTML files that will work together to present a unified website.</p>
<p>What’s more, whenever you add or change or delete any content, you can rerun your script file(s) to regenerate your new website, with everything updated to reflect the latest content.</p>
<p>As an example, the site at <a href="https://notenik.net">Notenik.net</a>, including this <a href="https://notenik.net/swift.html">User Guide</a>, was generated entirely using Notenik.</p>
