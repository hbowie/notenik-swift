<h1>
	Track Your Tasks
</h1>
<p>Add a Status field, a Seq field, a Date field and a Recurs field to a Collection, and you have all the elements of a personal task management system. </p>
<p>A Collection such as this can use the Date field to track due dates, and/or the Seq field to track priorities. If desired, use the Tags field to group tasks by context and/or by project. </p>
<p>If you use the Close Note option under the Note menu, then you can cause the Due Date to recur (if a Recurs field is available), or the Status field to show the task as Completed, if it is not eligible to recur. </p>
<p>The Sort menu contains two options specific to task tracking. The first option sorts all the Notes in a list by Date and then Seq, while the second option sorts all tasks by Seq and then Date. In both cases, completed tasks sort to the bottom of the list. </p>
<p>And don't forget the Purge Option under the File menu, which will allow you to purge Cancelled and Completed Notes from a Collection. </p>
