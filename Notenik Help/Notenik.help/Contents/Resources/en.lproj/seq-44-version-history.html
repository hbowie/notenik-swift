Version History
</h1>
<h3>Version 2.1.0 | 22 Nov 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Added Tags Mass Change Option</h4>
<p>Beneath the Collection menu an option has been added to perform a Tags Mass Change. The user will be prompted to specify from tags and to tags, and Notenik will then replace the from tags (in combination, if more than one is specified) with the to tags.</p>
<h4>2. Added Launch Link Menu Command and Keyboard Shortcut</h4>
<p>The Menu command can be found beneath the Note menu. The keyboard shortcut is CMD-L.</p>
<h4>3. Added Favorites Tab to Notenik Preferences</h4>
<p>The user can now change the Columns per Page, the Rows per Column, and the width of each Column on the Favorites tab of the application Preferences.</p>
<h3>Version 2.0.0 | 15 Nov 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Added New Scripter Input Modifier to Split Tags for Notenik Input</h4>
<p>When reading input data via the Scripter window, the user may now specify a modifier of ‘notenik-split-tags’ to add a ‘Tag’ field, and then return one row for each tag assigned to each note (or one row with a blank tag, for notes with no tags).</p>
<h4>2. Enabled Template Set Command operand of ++</h4>
<p>A Template Set command will now honor an operand of ‘++’ and increment the indicated variable by a value of 1.</p>
<h3>Version 1.9.0 | 11 Nov 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Fixed a Note Delete Bug</h4>
<p>A note that was being deleted would sometimes be immediately re-added. This has been corrected.</p>
<h4>2. Fixed an Attachments Bug</h4>
<p>Attachments were being deleted when the parent Note’s title was changed. This has now been corrected.</p>
<h4>3. Added Option to Reverse the Sort</h4>
<p>An option has been added to the Sort menu that will allow the user to reverse the current sequence of the list (from ascending to descending, or vice-versa).</p>
<h4>4. Scripter Can Now Read Markdown Headers</h4>
<p>Added a new input format to read a Markdown file and chunk it up into sections, based on its headers. Each resulting row of data will consist of fhe following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title - The text content of the header</li>
<li>Level - The level of the header (1 - 6)</li>
<li>Body - All of the text following the header, up to the next header.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the resulting data can be used to generate a Table of Contents for the Markdown file, using an appropriately formatted template.</p>
<h3>Version 1.8.0 | 06 Nov 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Folder Open thru Finder Drag-and-Drop Enabled</h4>
<p>Folder(s) may now be opened by dragging them onto the Notenik icon in the Finder. Notenik will respond in one of four ways to each Finder item.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a folder contains an existing Notenik Collection, then that Collection will be opened in a new window.</li>
<li>If a folder is empty, then it will be initialized as a new Notenik Collection, and opened in a new window.</li>
<li>if the dragged item is not a folder at all, then an error message will be displayed.</li>
<li>Any other folder will be treated as a parent realm, and the resulting window will show Collections and Scripts found within that realm.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Changed Deployment Target Back to 10.14 to Allow Operation on Mojave</h4>
<p>The last release inadvertently made Notenik unavailable to Mojave users.</p>
<h4>3. Reports Option Added to Generate Sample Report Templates</h4>
<p>When the user pulls down the Reports Action menu from the Toolbar, the first two items they see will now be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate Report Sample in HTML</li>
<li>Generate Report Sample in Markdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting one of these will then cause Notenik to create a reports folder for the collection, if one does not already exist, and then to create a report template containing all of the Collection’s fields in a basic layout. The user may then modify this template in order to further customize the output formatting.</p>
<h3>Version 1.7.0 | 31 Oct 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Markdown Applied to all Long Text fields</h4>
<p>Markdown is now used to format all longtext fields as they appear on the Display tab.</p>
<h4>2. Internal Refactoring</h4>
<p>Made some internal changes to handle field types in a way that will better lend itself to future growth.</p>
<h4>3. Additional Minor Improvements</h4>
<p>Made a few more minor improvements.</p>
<h4>4. Added Notenik Rate/Review Reminder</h4>
<p>Added code to remind users to rate and review Notenik on the Mac App Store.</p>
<h3>Version 1.6.0 | 15 Oct 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Various Minor Tweaks</h4>
<p>Made a number of tweaks to fix bugs and/or improve operation.</p>
<h4>2. Textile Parser Added</h4>
<p>A homegrown “good enough” Textile Parser has been added to Notenik. It can be invoked by including a file with a ‘.textile’ file extension when generating HTML output.</p>
<h4>3. Template Include File Conversion Honored</h4>
<p>When using the Include command within a Scripting Template file to include another file, automatic conversion will now be done when the included file extension differs from the output file extension. In particular, Markdown and Textile documents will be converted to HTML, when appropriate. Note that the Textile parser used is one internal to Notenik, and is at best a “good enough” tool, but one that is far from comprehensive.</p>
<h4>4. Seq Field Prefix Now Honored</h4>
<p>Field names beginning with “Seq” will now be treated as Seq fields for the purpose of sorting when using the Scripting Engine. This will cause numeric fields, for example, to sort into their proper numeric sequence, instead of treating them as alphanumeric fields.</p>
<h3>Version 1.5.0 | 20 Sep 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Enhanced Logic for Incrementing the Seq Field</h4>
<p>Made some improvements in the logic for incrementing the Seq field to properly increment following Notes to prevent overlap.</p>
<h4>2. Additional Refinements</h4>
<p>Fixed a bug that sometimes caused newline characters to be ignored when trying to load a Note from disk.</p>
<h4>3. Added a Dash as a New Variable Modifier</h4>
<p>A dash may now optionally follow the letter O, which will result in the html string produced by the Markdown conversion having opening and closing paragraph tags stripped from the resulting string.</p>
<h4>4. Added Special Treatment for Artist Field</h4>
<p>A field name of Artist will now be used as an alternate to Author when sorting by Author. A leading ‘The’ will be ignored, and values will be sorted as if they were all lower case.</p>
<h4>5. Added <longtext> option to Template file</h4>
<p>By specifying the value &lt;longtext&gt; as the value for a field in a template file, the user can now indicate that a field is to be a long text field, rather than a one-line text field.</p>
<h3>Version 1.4.1 | 08 Sep 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Added Checks Before Completing Save As</h4>
<p>The Save As command relies on the user creating a new folder to receive the copied contents of the current Collection. It then deletes the folder in order to take advantage of a native macOS command to copy the existing folder to the new location. However, this logic would allow the user to select an existing folder, containing other contents, and would then delete it. Notenik has been modified to make sure that the requested recipient of a Save As command is actually empty, before copying the old Collection to that (presumed new) location. The program is also now making an additional check to ensure the user doesn’t try to make his entire Desktop folder a Notenik Collection (even if it is empty).</p>
<h3>Version 1.4.0 | 03 Sep 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Work Type now uses a Combo Box</h4>
<p>When a Collection (typically, of quotations) has a ‘Work Type’ field, then Notenik will now present a standard, selectable list of options to choose from using what is known as a “Combo Box” control for editing.</p>
<h4>2. Improved Collection Load Speed</h4>
<p>Improved the speed of opening a new Collection by optimizing the sorting of Notes as they are loaded into memory.</p>
<h4>3. Miscellaneous Improvements</h4>
<p>A few minor bug fixes and minor improvements.</p>
<h4>4. Added Script File Recording</h4>
<p>Notenik can now be used to record script files, as well as play them back.</p>
<h3>Version 1.3.0 | 13 Aug 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Added Script File Playback</h4>
<p>Users can now play a Script file that will run a series of data transformations.</p>
<h4>2. Added Attachments Function</h4>
<p>Each Note can have one or more Attachments.</p>
<h4>3. Bug Fixes and Minor Improvements</h4>
<h4>4. Added Tags Export Preferences</h4>
<p>This new Notenik Preferences tab allows the user to specify tags to select and tags to suppress.</p>
<h3>Version 1.2.0 | 11 Jul 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Tokenized the Tags Field on the Edit Screen</h4>
<p>Users can now pick from previously identified tags when entering a new one.</p>
<h4>2. Bug Fixes and Improvements</h4>
<p>Markdown conversion now renders embedded HTML and does a smart typographic conversion.</p>
<p>Occasional problem with erroneous blanks in the ‘X’ column (indicating done or not) is now fixed.</p>
<h4>3. Added Standardize Dates to YMD to the Collection Menu</h4>
<p>Execution of this command will change all the dates in all the Notes for the current Collection so that they are stored in yyyy-mm-dd format, which can be useful to ensure than an export file sorts correctly on date.</p>
<h4>4. Added Split Tags Export to the File Menu</h4>
<p>The Split Tags command under the File menu will split the tags for each Note, and write one output row for each Tag for each Note. Notes without tags will be written out only once; Notes with multiple tags will be written out once for each Tag. In addition to the Tags column, a Tag (singular) column will be added to the front of each row, containing one particular Tag for the Note. This export file can be used, for example, to create an index page for each Tag.</p>
<h3>Version 1.1.0 | 05 Jul 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Various Bug Fixes and Improvements</h4>
<p>Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<h4>2. Added Reports Function</h4>
<p>Merge Templates may now be created, stored in a reports folder, and then run from a Collection’s Toolbar.</p>
<h4>3. Added Favorites to HTML Function</h4>
<p>The File Menu now has a new command to export Favorites to HTML. This allows the user to identify favorite bookmarks using the ‘Favorites’ tag and then export those favorites to a four-column Web page.</p>
<h3>Version 1.0.0 | 03 Jun 2019</h3>
<h4>1. Initial Release</h4>
<p>This is the initial release of Notenik written in Swift.</p>
