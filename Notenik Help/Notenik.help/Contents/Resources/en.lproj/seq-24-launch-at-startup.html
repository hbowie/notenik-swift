<h1>
	Launch at Startup
</h1>
<p>A special &#8216;Launch at Startup&#8217; tag can be added to a Note with a Link if you would like that Note's Link to be launched whenever Notenik starts up. </p>
<p>This special startup logic will only be executed once per day per Collection, and it will only be executed for a Collection that is automatically opened when Notenik starts up &#8211; such as an Essential Collection. </p>
