Add a Link Field to Make a Bookmark
</h1>
<p>A Link Field within Notenik is intended to hold a URL: a hyperlink to a location on the Web (or to a local file, if you’d prefer to use it that way).
You can easily Launch a link from within Notenik by clicking on the Launch Link button in the Toolbar, or by selecting Launch Link under the Note menu, or by using the keyboard shortcut CMD-L.</p>
<p>Adding a Link to a Note doesn’t necessarily reduce the Note to a simple Bookmark, but this is certainly one way to use a Collection of Notes.</p>
<p>Note that if you use a Link to point to a local folder containing another Notenik Collection, then Launching that Link will result in opening the linked Collection within Notenik.</p>
<p>You may use the Set Local Link command under the Note menu to choose a file or folder to be linked; the resulting ‘file:///’ style of URL will then replace any value previously stored in the Link field for the current Note.</p>
