	Add a Link Field to Make a Bookmark
</h1>
<p>A Link Field within Notenik is intended to hold a URL: a hyperlink to a location on the Web (or to a local file, if you&rsquo;d prefer to use it that way).</p>
<p>You can easily Launch a link from within Notenik, either by using the dropdown to the left of the Link value, or by clicking on the Launch button in the Toolbar.</p>
<p>The Link Label dropdown also provides a couple of other options. Use the Tweak option to &ldquo;tweak&rdquo; your URL in some potentially useful ways; use the Disk File option to select a local file on your computer, to build a Link pointing to that file; use the Folder option to select a local folder.</p>
<p>The Tweak option may also be invoked from the Tools menu.</p>
<p>Adding a Link to a Note doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reduce the Note to a simple Bookmark, but this is certainly one way to use a Collection of Notes.</p>
<p>Note that if you use a Link to point to a local folder containing another Notenik Collection, then Launching that Link will result in closing the current Collection and opening the linked Collection within Notenik.</p>
<p>Look under the Collection menu for an option to Validate Links. Notenik will check all your Link Values to make sure they&rsquo;re accessible, and will add an &lsquo;Invalid URL&rsquo; tag to any Notes with unresponsive links.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a Link field to point to a local disk file, then you can use the Get File Info command under the Note menu to see more info about the file you&rsquo;ve linked to.</p>
