<h1>
	Find One or More Notes Containing Specified Text
</h1>
<p>The Find button on the Toolbar will search for the text specified in the blank space just to its left, and display the first Note containing this text in any field being searched. After finding the first occurrence, this button&rsquo;s text changes to &lsquo;Again&rsquo;, to allow you to search again for the next Note containing the specified text.</p>
<p>The Find function is also available on the Collection Menu. And, after an initial Find, a Find Again function is also available on the Collection Menu.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll also find a Replace function that will let you Search for one particular string of text, and then systematically replace it with another.</p>
<p>Note that the options on the Replace screen apply to a Search as well. If you&rsquo;re not finding what you&rsquo;re looking for, be sure to open the Replace screen to see which Search options are being used.</p>
