	Favorites to HTML
</h1>
<p>If you have a Collection of Notes representing Web Bookmarks, then you may wish to use the &#8216;Favorites&#8217; tag (or &#8216;Favourites&#8217; for those who prefer the British spelling) to identify the bookmarks you reference most often. You may then use a sub-tag within the &#8216;Favorites&#8217; tag to organize your favorite bookmarks into categories. Once you've identified your Favorites, then you may use the Favorites to HTML command under the File menu to create a Web page containing all your favorite bookmarks, organized under headings representing the categories you have chosen. Notenik will display your favorites in four columns, with a maximum of 32 lines per column. Assuming a reasonable number of favorite bookmarks, these will typically display all of your favorites within a single Web page on your Mac. You may then wish to identify the resulting page as the homepage within all of your Web browsers (Safari, Chrome, etc.). </p>
<p>Note that you can change the Columns per Page, the Rows per Column, and the width of each Column on the Favorites tab of the application Preferences. </p>
