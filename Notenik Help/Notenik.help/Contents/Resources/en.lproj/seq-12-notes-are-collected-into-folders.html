Notes are Collected into Folders
</h1>
<!-- Markdown to HTML conversion provided by NotenikMkdown -->
<p>Each Note is part of a Collection, and each Collection is stored in its own folder (aka directory). Each Note within a Collection must have its own unique Title. </p>
<p>You can organize your Notes into as many Collections as you would like, and store each Collection wherever you would like. </p>
<p>The Notenik application can open multiple Collections at a time, each in its own window. The Open Recent command under the File menu provides easy access to recently opened Collections. </p>
<p>You may use a command under the File menu to designate the current Collection as your Essential Collection. Once identified, this will be the first Collection opened each time the application launches.  </p>
<p>The Save As command under the File menu allows you to save an entire Collection in a new location, with the option to either keep the current location (effectively making a copy) or to delete it (effectively moving the Collection to a new location). </p>
<p>Note that Notenik does not make any assumptions about how you wish to name your Notenik folders. When creating a new Collection, or using Save As to save your current Collection to a new location, Notenik expects you to create and appropriately name a new folder that will contain your Collection. In other words, you should not simply select an existing folder with the expectation that Notenik will then create a subfolder to store your Collection. </p>
