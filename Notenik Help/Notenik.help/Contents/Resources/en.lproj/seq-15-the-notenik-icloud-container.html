The Notenik iCloud Container
</h1>
<p>Starting with Version 3.7.0, Notenik has its own iCloud container. </p>
<p>From the macOS Finder, you can see this container within <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201104">iCloud Drive</a>, appearing as a folder with the unsurprising name of &#8216;Notenik&#8217;. You can tell that this is a container for the app named Notenik, rather than an ordinary folder, by the Notenik app icon overlaid on the normal folder icon. </p>
<p>Within this Notenik iCloud Container, then, you would normally place one or more of your Notenik Collections, each with its own subfolder. </p>
<p>Because macOS knows that this folder is really a container for Notenik documents, it gives Notenik some special privileges here: any Collection stored in this folder can always be accessed by the Notenik app, without you having to explicitly select the Collection to be opened each time. </p>
<p>One easy way to access the Collections within the container is by choosing to open the &#8216;Collections Board&#8217; via an item beneath the File menu. Then, after clicking on the disclosure triangle to reveal the contents of &#8216;iCloud Notenik&#8217;, you will see a list of all the Collections within the Container. Double-click on one of them to open it (or select one and then click on the &#8216;Open&#8217; button below). </p>
<p>You can also use the Collections Board to create a new Collection within the iCloud container by typing in the desired name of the new Collection in the text field at the bottom of the window, then hitting the &#8216;New&#8217; button. </p>
<p>And oh, BTW, if and when a Notenik app for iOS ever appears, this is the folder that will be shared between the Mac and various iOS devices. </p>
