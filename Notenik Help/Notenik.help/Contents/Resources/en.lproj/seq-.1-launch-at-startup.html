	Launch at Startup
</h1>
<p>A special ‘Launch at Startup’ tag can be added to a Note with a Link if you would like that Note’s Link to be launched whenever Notenik starts up.</p>
<p>This special startup logic will only be executed once per day per Collection, and it will only be executed for a Collection that is automatically opened when Notenik starts up – such as an Essential Collection.</p>
