	Navigate Your Collections via the Board
</h1>
<p>The Navigation Board can be summoned via the File menu, or with the indicated keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>The Nav Board will also appear automatically if the user closes the last open Collection window.</p>
<p>The Nav Board shows all easily accessible Collections in an outline, and also offers a series of buttons allowing the user to perform various actions.</p>
<p>The outline appears to the left of the window. Available Collections are available within three different groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Help - The Help Notes appear here.</li>
<li>iCloud Container - These are the Collections stored within the [[Notenik iCloud Container]].</li>
<li>Recent - These are recently accessed Collections that are stored outside of the iCloud Container.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on a disclosure triangle, or double-click on the name of a group, in order to display/hide the Collections within the group.</p>
<p>Double-click on a Collection to open it, and dismiss the Nav Board.</p>
<p>Select one or more Collections in the outline, and then press one of the buttons on the right to perform the indicated action on the selected Collections.</p>
<p>Here is more info on the actions performed by each button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Selected – Open all of the Collections that are currently selected in the outline.</li>
<li>Open Other - If the desired Collection is not available within the outline, then click on this button so that you can select your Collection from your local file system.</li>
<li>Open Parent – Allows you to perform the [[Open Parent Realm]] action from the Nav Board.</li>
