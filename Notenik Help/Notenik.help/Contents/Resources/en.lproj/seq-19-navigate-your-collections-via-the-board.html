	Navigate Your Collections via the Board
</h1>
<p>The Navigation Board can be summoned via the File menu, or with the indicated keyboard shortcut. </p>
<p>The Nav Board will also appear automatically if the user closes the last open Collection window. </p>
<p>The Nav Board shows all easily accessible Collections in an outline, and also offers a series of buttons allowing the user to perform various actions. </p>
<p>A combo box appears at the top left of the board. Type the first few letters of the name of a Collection's folder in order to bring it up, then hit enter/return to select it. </p>
<p>The outline appears to the left of the window. Available Collections are available within three different groups. </p>
<ul>
