I appreciate you letting me know Herb. I did see your message before the meeting, I just didn't have a chance to respond earlier. Have a good evening.

Tyna,  
  
Sorry I won't be able to make it tonight.  
  
I enjoyed writing the two blog articles that I've been assigned so far. I'm happy to take on similar writing assignments in the future, should the need arise.  
  
I'm not particularly interested in the MoC meetings, and I'm not much on social media, so probably won't be of much use in these areas.  
  
Take care.

Hi Indivisibles!  
  
I sure hope you're able to make our Zoom meeting this Thursday evening @7:30PM because we have a very ambitious agenda with perhaps the most important topics/projects we've worked on all year.   
  
On top of our WIP communications projects trying to stop the conservative Referendum 90 from overturning sex education in ours school, and our #YourChoice social media project comparing Trump/Biden, we need to develop a communications plan ASAP for persuading our representatives to support Seattle Indivisible's priorities in the next COVID-19 relief bill. And that includes planning for a meeting with Rep. Jayapal this coming Tuesday!  So please join us, we need your time, talents and input. Any time you have to give is appreciated.
