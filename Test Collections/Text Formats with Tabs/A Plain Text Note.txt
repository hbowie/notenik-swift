Body:

This is an outline. 
	Tabs are used for indention. 
		This is another indent.
	And another 2nd-level.
Let's make a longer outline. 

A number of authors and systems of thought espouse one or another series of developmental levels, in fields of study as diverse as psychology, sociology, economics and organizational development. [Ken Wilber][wilber] was the first author I encountered who proposed an integration of these various developmental progressions into a single unifying scheme. However, much of Ken's take  on these levels was heavily influenced by the [Spiral Dynamics][spiral] work done by [Clare W. Graves][graves], [Don Beck][beck] and Chris Cowan. (And Hanzi Freinacht provides yet another take on this stuff in his book *[The Listening Society](https://www.amazon.com/Listening-Society-Metamodern-Politics-Guides/dp/8799973901)*.)

So what do we mean by a level of development, in this context?

Here's where it gets a little tricky. 

Both in terms of individual development, and in terms of sociocultural development, these levels seem to emerge in a certain sequence. 

However, later levels do not supersede or invalidate earlier levels. Rather than replacing previous levels, each emergent level expands the complexity and capacity of individuals and societies. 

And so Wilber and Beck and Cowan have tried to use colors to identify the levels, rather than numbers, in order to avoid giving the impression that later levels are somehow superior to earlier levels.

At some point along the line, though, Ken Wilber and the Integral crew decided it was important to change some of the colors. I've listed both the original Spiral Dynamics colors and the newer Integral colors in the table below, but in general I will stick with the original colors from Beck and Cowan. 

Also, there has been a later tendency to add new, higher, levels to the upper end of this range. I've not been able to make much sense of these, myself, so I'm omitting them here. 

As we go through these levels we can make use of [[The Four Quadrants]] model to see that each level has a particular subjective, or intersubjective viewpoint, as well as typical social structures that can be identified from an interobjective perspective.

There's a certain chicken and the egg sort of dilemma we face when trying to disentangle the objective social aspects of a level from its subjective aspects but, for me, it feels more natural to consider the objective social aspects first, so I'll proceed in that manner.

Also, it's worth noting that, as we proceed through the levels, they tend to alternate between an assertion of individual power (archaic, tribal, modern, integral), and then a more community-based perspective (magical, traditional, postmodern, holistic). 

Here's a table listing all of the levels, with their associated colors. (By the way, Spiral Dynamics uses the terms "Value Meme," or "vMeme" to refer to a level.)
