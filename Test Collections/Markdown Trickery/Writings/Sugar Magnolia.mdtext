> Sugar Magnolia blossom's blooming  
> Head's all empty and I don't care  
> Saw my baby down by the river  
> Knew she'd have to come up soon for air  
>   
> Sweet blossom come on under the willow  
> We can have high times if you'll abide  
> We can discover the wonders of nature  
> Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside  
>   
> She's got everything delightful  
> She's got everything I need  
> Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double  
> Pays my ticket when I speed  
>   
> She come skimming through rays of violet  
> She can wade in a drop of dew  
> She don't come and I don't follow  
> Waits backstage while I sing to you  
>   
> She can dance a Cajun rhythm  
> Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive  
> She's a summer love in the spring, fall and winter  
> She can make happy any man alive  
>   
> Sugar magnolia  
> Ringin' that blue bell  
> Caught up in sunlight  
> Come on out singing  
> I'll walk you in the sunshine  
> Come on honey, come along with me  
>   
> She's got everything delightful  
> She's got everything I need  
> A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight  
> Crazy in the sunlight yes indeed  
>   
> Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying  
> When the moon is halfway down  
> Sometimes when the night is dying  
> I take me out and I wander round  
> I wander round  
>   
> Sunshine daydream  
> Walking through the tall trees  
> Going where the wind goes  
> Blooming like a red rose  
> Breathing more freely  
> Light out singing  
> I'll walk you in the morning sunshine  
> Sunshine daydream  
> Walk you in the sunshine  
>
