# Passage: 1 John 1:1 - 2:6 (NIV) The Incarnation of the Word of Life
1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched —this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to make our joy complete.
**Light and Darkness, Sin and Forgiveness**
5 This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.
8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.
1 My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
**Love and Hatred for Fellow Believers**
3 We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. 4 Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. 5 But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him: 6 Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.

## Thoughts
- 1.1 eye + hand-witnesses!  c.f. John end? "24 This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. 25 Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."
- 1.3 purpose: fellowship with us and with God.  Outcome greatest possible joy.  c.f. Luke 1:1-4 "1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught."
- 1.2 focus: eternal Word of life
- 1.5 his message: walk in the light of God, as justified people (by Christ's blood) 
- 1.8, 1.10 we all sin: don't deny it
- 1.9, 2.1 but forgiveness comes if we ask the Father via Jesus the (only) righteous one
- 2.2 Jesus gives atoning sacrifice
- 2.3-6 obedience to God's commands shows our love for Him, living as Jesus did.

## Specific ideas
- eyewitness testimony: why write? Know truth, Know God, joy for fellow Christians
- sin: no new ways of sinning this year, but a number have come to prominence: institutional racism alleged in labour and conservative parties
- 

## General Ideas
John Lennox:
Creation/Genesis includes 'and god said to them' ... revelation is there; God wants us as conversation partners
--> most appropriate Christmas present of all, is one to receive: hear from God; come to relationship with God; talk with God.

## Idea for Christmas Eve
CHRISTMAS CAROL: G.A.Studdert Kennedy

COME worship the King, 
       That little white thing, 
Asleep on His Mother's soft breast. 
       Ye bright stars, bow down, 
       Weave for Him a crown, 
Christ Jesus by angels confessed. 

Come, children, and peep,  
       But hush ye, and creep 
On tiptoe to where the Babe lies;  
       Then whisper His Name 
       And lo! like a flame 
The Glory light shines in His eyes.  

Come, strong men, and see  
       This high mystery, 
Tread firm where the shepherds have trod,  
       And watch, 'mid the hair 
       Of the Maiden so fair, 
The five little fingers of God. 

Come, old men and grey, 
       The star leads the way, 
It halts, and your wanderings cease; 
       Look down on His Face, 
       Then, filled with His Grace, 
Depart ye, God's servants, in Peace.


## Commentary
### Nick Baines' thought for the day, Late 2019
Leonard Cohen ... Try this: “No one to follow and nothing to teach except that the goal falls short of the reach.” Now, isn’t that what we all feel most of the time? The goal falls short of the reach; we get disappointed that we aren’t all we want to be. We mess things up and get stuff wrong, and wish we could be better. Or am I the only one?

I was once asked in a radio interview about Leonard Cohen if he had “hijacked religious language” – like in his song Hallelujah. My answer was that, rather than hijacking it, he had actually understood it! “The holy and the broken hallelujah”. That’s what we all are, isn’t it? As we prepare for Christmas in a few weeks’ time, this goes to the heart of my longing: a God who in Jesus comes among us as one of us and subjects himself to all that the world can throw at him … without throwing it back. Taking broken people and making them whole. Running with the grain of who they are, but opening up a world of being infinitely loved and valued. Challenging the prejudices of powerful men and giving life to people who thought they were worthless because their goal fell short of the reach.

Whatever form you take, the shape of you is unique and uniquely loved. Broken, forgiven, restored. And that, I think, is very good news.

### (PTW (40 Vol)) 
**1.1-5** THE GREAT ACTOR and film director Woody Allen claims to be an atheist. On one occasion he was asked the question, “If there is a God, and if that God should speak to you, what would you most want to hear him say?” Woody Allen’s answer speaks for all people. He said, “If there is a God who should speak to me, I would most want to hear him say three words, ‘You are forgiven.’” John says the only way you will ever hear from God the words “you are forgiven” is if you speak the words “I have sinned.” J. B. Phillips said there are nearly as many wrong ideas about sin as there are false ideas about God. As a Christian, what do you do when you sin? What should you do when you sin? Sometimes, even for Christians, sin is something we do and then deny. We love to rationalize it, and we love to refine it. Sometimes we just don’t take seriously the reality and consequences of our sin. We claim closeness with God but then defy his will and live contrary to his character! What scandal! Even for Christians, sometimes the three hardest words to say when they ought to be said and like they ought to be said are “I have sinned.” But when we utter those words in sincerity, God’s response is always “You are forgiven.”

Happy Christmas!

## Intro
Pray: Father God, open up our eyes to see, our ears to hear and our hearts to receive what you have prepared for us this night. (And everyone who is looking forward to Christmas says,) Amen! (Dan Lian, Newspring)

Q: Favourite carol? Hopefully you've got to sing one or two of the tonight.
Or perhaps you work in a place that demands a recorded loop of 8 jingly carols is played non-stop for the last month? And right now you're close to attacking lovely Alex here for playing yet more of them. 

## Incarnation
### A CHRISTMAS CAROL: G.A.Studdert Kennedy
Here's the words of a carol you may not know:

COME worship the King, 
       That little white thing, 
Asleep on His Mother's soft breast. 
       Ye bright stars, bow down, 
       Weave for Him a crown, 
Christ Jesus by angels confessed. 

Come, children, and peep,  
       But hush ye, and creep 
On tiptoe to where the Babe lies;  
       Then whisper His Name 
       And lo! like a flame 
The Glory light shines in His eyes.  

Come, strong men, and see  
       This high mystery, 
Tread firm where the shepherds have trod,  
       And watch, 'mid the hair 
       Of the Maiden so fair, 
The five little fingers of God. 

Come, old men and grey, 
       The star leads the way, 
It halts, and your wanderings cease; 
       Look down on His Face, 
       Then, filled with His Grace, 
Depart ye, God's servants, in Peace.

This carol is yet to be set to music, captures for me the wonder that is Christmas. Sometimes we sing of the glory, the majesty, the splendour of God. "Glory ... in the highest!" And all that is good, all that is true. "And glory shone around" pokes its head into the Christmas story. Infrequently, though. Mostly it's long and difficult journeys, shame and discomfort. 

You can hardly go a day in the TV schedules without Royalty making an appearance. Not just the Queen's speech later today, or historical dramas with Royalty like _The Crown_, or the recent State Opening of Parliament. Lots of pageantry, courtiers, big rooms and the finest clothes. We've been watching _Wolf Hall_ set many centuries ago, but it was just the same. A new child is eventually born to Henry VIII, and she of course wants for nothing.

How different this boy born to be King. You don't get much more "little weak and helpless" than a newborn of unwed mother, in a borrowed shelter two weeks walk from home, in an insignificant backwater of a despised nation under the thumb of an occupying army. This isn't glory in the highest, but glory in the lowest! This -- this! -- is the place and time God chose. This is where startled shepherds and three Zorastrians first see "The five little fingers of God" ...

## Passing the Message on
It takes some effort ...

Our reading wasn't one of the usual Christmas readings ... 1 John 1 cf John 1.
Apostle John gives us the reason for writing his Gospel: Read: Jn 21.24-25: "This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."
He regards his eye-witness testimony as being important.
His friend the apostle Luke is even clearer about why he wrote his eye-witness account: Read: Luke 1:1-4 "1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught."

They want those who weren't there in Jerusalem and Galilee to be equally certain about what Jesus did and said, and what happened to him.

John also gives us the reason for writing this first letter: Read: 1 John 1: "1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched ... 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you ... 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard ..." We get the point.

What is the message though? Read: v1b-3: "1b this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to make our joy complete."

What does he want us to do with this? Read: v3-4 ... fellowship with us and with God.  Outcome greatest possible joy.

## The Problem
Which begs the question: what's getting in the way of this greatest joy? This year we lost one of our best song-smiths who worked away at this question: the Canadian legend Leonard Cohen. His songs were famously 'death-haunted', as well as themes of sexuality, loss, depression, and isolation.  His biggest hit, rather ironically, was of course _Hallelujah_. But get beyond the title, and we soon find "The holy and the broken hallelujah". In a different song he counselled there's “No one to follow and nothing to teach except that the goal falls short of the reach.” Now, isn’t that what we all feel most of the time? The goal falls short of the reach; we get disappointed that we aren’t all we want to be. We mess things up and get stuff wrong, and wish we could be better. Or am I the only one? We fall short, and in so doing we frequently hurt ourselves and cause distance with others. 

This image of an arrow shot from a bow, but that falls short of the target, is just one picture of 'sin'. We fall short of the good target God intends for us. John writes this quite bluntly Read: v8: "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."

We're used to the idea of progress: every year things will get better. That's the promise in the West, isn't it? However, the Queen's just described 2019 as a difficult year. Apart from Boris, I guess most people would agree. Certainly I see no improvement in divisions about Europe, and precious little action to combat the climate breakdown. But on the even bigger questions, have we actually made any headway in the last few, err, millennia? As a species we are still prone to division, to greed, to violence, for putting 'me' rather than 'us' first. We find it difficult to love our neighbours; fat chance of ever getting round to loving our enemies.

Only now does our God with five little fingers begin to make some sense. He comes to the heart of the problem. A God who in Jesus comes among us as one of us and subjects himself to all that the world can throw at him ... without throwing it back. Taking broken people and making them whole. Running with the grain of who they are, but opening up a world of being infinitely loved and valued. Challenging the prejudices of powerful men and giving life to people who thought they were worthless because their goal fell short of the reach.

Or in the words of John: Read: v9: "9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."

Christmas is great. Not because of gifts whose allure may sadly soon fade. Because "Look! God has shown up to put things right. In becoming man, the Lord of all has taken the wheel of this world, switched on the GPS, and pressed ‘Home’!"^[Glen S]

## Video version
Let me put this another way. Or, let me show this to you a different way. I've got two videos, the first of which I imagine most of the country have enjoyed: {Video: John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 }. What a heart-warming tale of love and acceptance despite difference, at this Winter Festival.

Some bright spark has taken this, and joined it to, well, the real Christmas story: {Video: There's a Dragon in my Nativity -- https://youtu.be/DyC5RHKNBm4}

...

## Ending
Pray: this Christmas night, in the words of one of our carols, Lord Jesus, we need your help. "Be born in us today."
Amen.

## My review thoughts
- Done in a hurry: probably could integrate other parts of the passage more cleanly.
- Too long with the videos?
- Make more of what church is all about?
