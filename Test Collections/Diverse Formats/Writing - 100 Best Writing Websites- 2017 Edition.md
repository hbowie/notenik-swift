What do you picture when you imagine yourself writing? 

Are you quietly tapping away on your office desktop computer in the early morning hours? Maybe you're scribbling new ideas and observations amidst the hustle and bustle of a coffee shop. 

It's likely that you imagined yourself alone. And that's not surprising, because when it comes down to actually doing the work, you — the writer — are the one who has to put pen to paper. 

But here's the thing about great writing: it takes a village. 

They may be _your_ words, but the words you write are a culmination of years of practice, learning from mentors, emulating your favorite authors, workshopping with peers and supporting fellow writers. 

Each year, The Write Life celebrates this "village" by releasing a list of the 100 Best Websites for Writers, and we're excited to do so again this year. 

Thanks to your suggestions, you've helped us curate hundreds of websites to bring you the best of the best. 

**Many are tried-and-true favorites previously featured in our [****2014**][1]**, [****2015**][2]**, and [****2016**][3]** lists, and this year we're thrilled to feature more than 50 newcomers. **

Each website featured in this list meets the following criteria: 

* It was recommended by readers of The Write Life
* It publishes content helpful to writers
* It has been updated recently and regularly

We've broken our 2017 list into eight categories: Blogging, creativity and craft, editing, freelancing, marketing and platform building, podcasts, publishing and writing communities. **For the first time, we are excited to include a category for podcasts, which have proven to be a powerful and growing resource for writers. **All sites are listed in alphabetical order within their categories, with numbers for ease of reading (not ranking). 

No matter what your writing goals are, there's something here for everyone. 

And if you want to start your own website or blog, [here's our step-by-step guide][4]. Your website could be next on our list!
