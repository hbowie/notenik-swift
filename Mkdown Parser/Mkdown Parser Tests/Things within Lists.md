Title:  Things within Lists

Seq:    5.2

Body: 

To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote's `>`
delimiters need to be indented:

*   Item one

*   A list item with a blockquote:

	> This is a blockquote
	> inside a list item.

To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs
to be indented *twice* -- 8 spaces or two tabs:

*   Item one

*   A list item with a code block:

		<code goes here>
