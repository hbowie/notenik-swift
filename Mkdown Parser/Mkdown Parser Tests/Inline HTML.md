Title:  Inline HTML

Seq:    11

Body: 

If you wish to use inline HTML, you can just use it, as John Gruber points out in his <cite>Markdown Syntax page</cite>.

On the other hand, you can still say that 1 < 3, and 5 > 4.

Quotation marks should be <a href="https://notenik.net">left alone</a> inside of <a href='https://practopian.org'>inline HTML tags</a>.
