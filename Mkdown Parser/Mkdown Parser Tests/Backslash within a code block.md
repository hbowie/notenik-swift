Title:  Backslash within a code block

Seq:    8.2

Body: 

It's worth noting that it's possible to trigger an ordered list by
accident, by writing something like this:

    1986. What a great season.

In other words, a *number-period-space* sequence at the beginning of a
line. To avoid this, you can backslash-escape the period:

    1986\. What a great season.

 \*literal asterisks\*
