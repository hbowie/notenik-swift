Title:  Left Angle Brackets and Ampersands

Status: 9 - Tested

Seq:    1.3.1

Body: 

In HTML, there are two characters that demand special treatment: `<`
and `&`. Left angle brackets are used to start tags; ampersands are
used to denote HTML entities. If you want to use them as literal
characters, you must escape them as entities, e.g. `&lt;`, and
`&amp;`.

So, if you want to include a copyright symbol in your article, you can write:

    &copy;

and Markdown will leave it alone. But if you write:

    AT&T

Markdown will translate it to:

    AT&amp;T

Similarly, because Markdown supports [inline HTML](#html), if you use
angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markdown will treat them as
such. But if you write:

    4 < 5

Markdown will translate it to:

    4 &lt; 5

However, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle brackets and
ampersands are *always* encoded automatically. This makes it easy to use
Markdown to write about HTML code. (As opposed to raw HTML, which is a
terrible format for writing about HTML syntax, because every single `<`
and `&` in your example code needs to be escaped.)
