The phrase `Minutes to Read` can be used as both a label and a type.

A Collection should only have one field of type `minutes-to-read`.

The value for this field will be calculated automatically by Notenik, based on the number of words found in the [[Body]] field, figuring 200 words per minute, and rounding to the nearest whole number.
