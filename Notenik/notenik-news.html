<h2>2021 Apr 07 &mdash; macOS version 5.8.1 released</h2>

<h4 id="attempting-to-fix-a-crash-occurring-when-using-merge-templates">1. Attempting to Fix a Crash Occurring when using Merge Templates</h4>
<p>I say &#8220;attempting&#8221; because the crash does not occur in my development build, but only in the version once released to the Mac App Store. </p>

<h2>2021 Mar 28 &mdash; macOS version 5.8.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="fixed-a-bug-that-was-resulting-in-a-double-descending-sort">1. Fixed a Bug that was resulting in a double descending sort</h4>
<p>When sorting via the Scripting module, the sort was honoring both the direction specified in the script commands, as well as the direction specified most recently in the Collection preferences. If both were set to descending, then the result would be a double-negative, resulting in an ascending sort. This has been fixed. </p>
<h4 id="added-page-type-as-an-additional-column-for-notenik-index-scripting-input">2. Added Page Type as an additional column for notenik-index scripting input</h4>
<p>If the Collection has a Type field, then this will appear in the Page Type column generated when using the notenik-index scripting input type. </p>
<h4 id="tweaked-the-linked-tags-template-variable-modifier">3. Tweaked the Linked Tags Template Variable Modifier</h4>
<p>One or more CSS classes can now be specified, to be applied to the link generated for each tag. These should be specified following the path, with an intervening semicolon to separate the two. </p>
<h4 id="added-an-author-name-variable-modifier">4. Added an Author Name Variable Modifier</h4>
<p>Use the letter &#8220;A&#8221;, followed by a &#8220;1&#8221; or a &#8220;2&#8221;, to replace the full name with the last name only, or with the last name first, followed by a comma and the first name. </p>
<h4 id="added-copyfile-template-command">5. Added copyfile template command</h4>
<p>A <code>copyfile</code> command can now be used, as part of a merge template, to copy an accompanying file (typically an image file identified by the new Image Name field) to an appropriate output destination, from which it can be accessed by an output web page. </p>
<h4 id="added-image-name-field-label-and-type">6. Added Image Name field label and type</h4>
<p>The user can now specify the name to be associated with a Note, by selecting from a list of available attachments. </p>
<h4 id="added-minutes-to-read-field-label-and-type">7. Added Minutes to Read field label and type</h4>
<p>The value will be calculated automatically, based on the number of words found in the body field, figuring 200 words per minute, then rounding to the nearest whole number. </p>
<h4 id="refactoring-of-file-input-output-routines">8. Refactoring of file input/output routines</h4>
<p>Extensive refactoring of file input and output routines to isolate actual interactions with the file system. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2021 Feb 21 &mdash; macOS version 5.7.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="fixed-a-bug-that-prevented-note-duplication">1. Fixed a bug that prevented Note Duplication</h4>
<p>When initiating a Note Duplication from the menu, the app would enter an endless loop. This has been fixed. </p>
<h4 id="notenik-now-retains-last-note-selection-between-launches">2. Notenik now retains last Note Selection between launches</h4>
<p>When a Collection is closed, Notenik will now make a record of the last Note that was selected by the user. The next time that Collection is opened, Notenik will re-select that same note. </p>
<h4 id="added-drag-and-drop-for-file-attachments">3. Added Drag and Drop for File Attachments</h4>
<p>You can now start the process of adding an attachment to a note by dragging the file to be attached onto the target Note's row in the List tab. The Note should be in Display mode, and not in Edit mode, before starting the drag. </p>

<h2>2021 Feb 12 &mdash; Using Notenik in Some Trendy, Cool Ways</h2>

<p>Added an option to sort a list in sequence by date added. </p>
<h4 id="simplified-means-of-creating-a-new-collection">2. Simplified Means of Creating a New Collection</h4>
<p>There is a new option beneath the File menu that simply prompts the user to create a New Collection. Selecting this option brings up a tabbed window that walks the user through three steps: selecting a parent folder; naming the Collection; and choosing a Collection Type (which in turn implies a set of fields). </p>
<h4 id="changing-of-file-extensions-enabled">3. Changing of File Extensions Enabled</h4>
<p>When you change the Preferred File Extension for a Collection, by modifying the Collection Preferences, Notenik will now change the file extensions for all the Notes in the Collection to the new value, instead of only changing the extension of the template file. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2021 Feb 03 &mdash; New Info on Fields and Labels</h2>

<h4 id="enabled-open-link-in-new-window-for-all-hyperlinks-on-the-display-tab">1. Enabled Open Link in New Window for all hyperlinks on the Display Tab</h4>
<p>By using a Secondary Click (otherwise known as a right-click or a control-click) on a hyperlink showing on the Display tab, the user can see a contextual (aka shortcut) menu with the option to <code>Open Link in New Window</code>. Before this change, selecting this option did nothing. It will now attempt to pass the link to your preferred Web browser, requesting that it be opened there. </p>
<h4 id="added-support-for-extensive-field-renaming">2. Added Support for Extensive Field Renaming</h4>
<p>Through judicious edits to a Collection's template file, Notenik will allow all of its special fields to be renamed. </p>

<p>The user can now right-click on a row on the List tab and select any of the following actions: </p>

<p>Changed the logic a bit on the Display Prefs screen to make updating a bit more intuitive. </p>
<h4 id="adjusted-font-weight-in-whats-new-display">5. Adjusted Font Weight in What's New Display</h4>
<p>Headings were a bit too heavy. </p>
<h4 id="corrected-sharing-of-entire-note-in-markdown">6. Corrected Sharing of Entire Note in Markdown</h4>

<h4 id="added-convenience-function-to-edit-collections-template-file">2. Added Convenience Function to Edit Collection's Template file</h4>
<p>Beneath the Collection menu the user will now find an item to Text Edit the Collection's Template file. If any changes are made to this file, then the following menu item, to Reload the Collection, should be executed next in order to pull in the modified template file. </p>

<p>Added a Combo Box at the top left of the Navigation Board, allowing the user to type the first few letters of a Collection's folder name, and then hit enter/return to select an available folder. </p>
<h4 id="added-whats-new-display">5. Added What's New? display</h4>
<p>Immediately beneath the Help menu the user can now find a request to answer the question of What's New? Selecting this item will display a window showing the latest Notenik news, including both version releases and blog posts. This window will be shown to the user automatically once for each new release. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2021 Jan 04 &mdash; macOS version 5.2.0 released</h2>

<p>This should close Issue # 40. </p>

<p>In particular, application URL links should now be working, both from the Link field, and when found in the body field. </p>

<h2>2020 Dec 10 &mdash; Notenik Turns the Big Five-O!</h2>

<p>Yes, that's right &#8211; Notenik version 5.0.0 has just been released, in all likelihood closing the books on 2020. So this feels like a good time to take a breather and look back on the path we've traveled, along with new routes yet to explore. </p>

<p>This seems to work more intuitively now. </p>
<h4 id="modified-to-allow-urls-linking-to-files">2. Modified to allow URLs linking to files</h4>
<p>URLs starting with &#8216;file:&#8217; should now be recognized as valid URLs. </p>
<p>However, permissions issues may still prevent such links from being usefully resolved, if they link outside of the sandbox to a file for which the app does not have access privileges. </p>
<p>This should resolve Issue # 42. </p>
<h4 id="fixed-bug-in-persisting-custom-css">3. Fixed Bug in Persisting Custom CSS</h4>
<p>Notenik allows custom CSS to be entered in the Display Fonts Preferences, but these custom entries were being overwritten when Notenik was relaunched. This has now been corrected. This should close Issue # 41. </p>
<h4 id="fixed-bug-handling-parentheses-within-link-text">4. Fixed bug handling parentheses within Link text</h4>
<p>Parentheses within link text were not getting handled properly. </p>
<h4 id="back-prior-now-relaunches-a-note-after-following-a-link">5. Back/Prior now relaunches a Note after following a link</h4>

<h4 id="fixed-bug-in-move-collection-logic">6. Fixed Bug in Move Collection Logic</h4>
<p>The &#8216;alias.txt&#8217; file was not being copied. This has been corrected. </p>

<h4 id="added-new-file-command-to-create-a-new-collection-in-icloud">1. Added new File Command to create a New Collection in iCloud</h4>

<h4 id="added-new-command-to-stash-notes-in-subfolder">2. Added New Command to Stash Notes in Subfolder</h4>
<p>This command can be found beneath the Transform menu. This command makes an existing Collection compliant with the new structure for a Web Collection by creating a subfolder named &#8216;notes&#8217; and them moving the existing Notes into that subfolder. </p>
<h4 id="added-new-command-to-move-a-collection">3. Added New Command to Move a Collection</h4>
<p>The Move command can be found beneath the File menu. This command will copy an existing Collection to a new location, and then delete the original Collection. </p>

<h4 id="display-font-selection-list-can-now-include-all-available-fonts">4. Display Font Selection List Can Now Include all Available Fonts</h4>
<p>A checkbox has been added to the Display Fonts window that, when checked, will result in the list of available fonts being expanded to include all font families available on the user's Mac. If unchecked, the user will only be able to select from a relatively short list of common fonts. </p>
<p>This should close Issue # 38. </p>
<h4 id="launch-at-startup-tag-enabled">5. Launch at Startup tag enabled</h4>
<p>Adding a &#8216;Launch at Startup&#8217; tag to a Note will now cause the Note's link to be launched when Notenik starts up. </p>

<p>The Navigation Board can be summoned via the File menu. It will also appear if the user closes the last open Collection (thus providing a resolution for Issue # 19). The Nav Board shows all easily accessible Collections in an outline, and also offers a series of buttons allowing the user to perform other actions with selected Collections. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 Sep 01 &mdash; macOS version 4.5.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="tags-now-disappear-when-they-are-no-longer-used">1. Tags now Disappear when they are No Longer Used</h4>

<p>This closes issue # 33. </p>
<h4 id="saving-divider-position">2. Saving Divider Position</h4>
<p>The last position of the divider between the list view and the note view is now being saved between executions. </p>
<p>This closes Issue # 21. </p>
<h4 id="ignore-internal-resources-folder-when-offering-parent-folder-for-new-collection">3. Ignore Internal Resources folder when offering parent folder for new collection</h4>
<p>Notenik was previously offering the parent folder for the app's Help Notes as the possible parent for a new collection to be created by the user. This has been fixed, closing Issue # 32. </p>
<h4 id="removed-collections-board">4. Removed Collections Board</h4>
<p>Removed the Collections Board, since it was just a bad idea poorly executed. </p>

<p>Made a code change that might have been causing a crash during the application launch. </p>
<h4 id="added-ability-to-increment-major-portion-of-seq-field">3. Added Ability to Increment Major Portion of Seq Field</h4>
<p>The Note menu has a new command, with its own keyboard shortcut, allowing a two-part Seq field (i.e., 1.00) to be incremented on the left, rather than on the right. In other words, the major portion of the Seq number is incremented, rather than the minor portion. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 Aug 02 &mdash; macOS version 4.3.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="added-the-ability-to-specify-a-boolean-field">1. Added the Ability to Specify a Boolean Field</h4>
<p>Supplying a value of <code>&lt;bool&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;boolean&gt;</code> for a field in a Collection's template file will produce a field that can have a value of <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, and that will be represented on the Edit tab as a checkbox. </p>

<h4 id="eliminated-trimming-of-merge-template-lines">5. Eliminated trimming of Merge Template Lines</h4>
<p>Merge template lines were being trimmed &#8211; that is, leading and trailing spaces and tabs were being removed. That should no longer be occurring. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 Jul 10 &mdash; macOS version 4.2.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="enhanced-wiki-link-functionality">1. Enhanced Wiki Link Functionality</h4>
<p>For a Collection using Timestamps, Notenik will now maintain an alias list (stored in a file named &#8216;alias.txt&#8217;) containing all the wiki link text values that have ever been used to point to another Note in the Collection. Each Alias entry will match the linking text to the timestamp for the linked note. If the title for the linked note is ever changed, the alias file will be used to look up the right note, even if the link to the target note has not been updated. (Might have also fixed a bug or two along the way.) </p>
<h4 id="fixed-an-ifendgroup-template-bug">2. Fixed an ifendgroup Template bug</h4>
<p>When processing a merge template, ifendgroup commands were not being properly processed after the last note had been processed. </p>
<h4 id="added-open-from-icloud-item-to-the-file-menu">3. Added Open from iCloud item to the File Menu</h4>

<h4 id="added-a-new-sort-option-for-tags-plus-seq-fields">3. Added a new Sort Option for Tags Plus Seq Fields</h4>

<h2>2020 Jun 10 &mdash; macOS version 4.0.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="added-import-option-for-xml">1. Added Import Option for XML</h4>
<p>At a minimum, this will allow former iWisdom users to import their old collections into Notenik. </p>
<h4 id="added-double-click-actions-to-the-tags-tab">2. Added Double-Click Actions to the Tags Tab</h4>
<p>Double-clicking on a row in the Tags tab will now cause one of two actions: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you're double-clicking on a tag, then double-clicking will expand or collapse it; </li>
<li>If you're double-clicking on a Note, then double-clicking will attempt to launch whatever is in the Link field for the Note, just as double-clicking does on the List tab. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="table-of-contents-generation-for-markdown">3. Table of Contents Generation for Markdown</h4>
<p>Adding a line containing only &#8216;[toc]&#8217; within the body field will now cause that line to be replaced by a table of contents containing links to all of the headings following the &#8216;[toc]&#8217; line. This will only happen if you have chosen to use the Notenik Markdown parser in the Notenik preferences. </p>
<h4 id="additional-support-for-link-field-variants">4. Additional Support for Link field variants</h4>
<p>Any field whose label contains the word &#8216;link&#8217; will now be treated as a Link field, and will be shown as a clickable link on the Display tab. Additionally, if a Note does not have a simple &#8216;Link&#8217; field, then launching the Note's link, or double-clicking on the Note, will cause the first non-blank link field on the Note to be used. </p>
<h4 id="links-need-no-longer-start-with-https">5. Links need no longer start with https</h4>
<p>A Link may now be entered without any URL scheme, so long as the implicit scheme of &#8216;https://&#8217; will be sufficient to access the link. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 May 29 &mdash; macOS version 3.9.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="added-a-counts-window">1. Added a Counts Window</h4>

<hr />
<h2>2020 May 21 &mdash; macOS version 3.8.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="improved-note-sharing">1. Improved Note Sharing</h4>
<p>Added a keyboard shortcut to invoke the Share dialog accessed from the Note menu, and also straightened out some of the Note sharing formats to make them more useful. </p>
<h4 id="made-collection-open-save-dialogs-modal">2. Made Collection Open/Save Dialogs Modal</h4>
<p>When creating a new Collection, or opening an existing one, the screens presented are now modal, which means that they must be dealt with by the user before going back to another screen. This should prevent some common errors from occurring that sometimes resulted when the user ended up going back to the wrong screen before completing a New/Open operation. </p>
<h4 id="cleaned-up-note-delete-logic">3. Cleaned Up Note Delete Logic</h4>
<p>There were several visual oddities that might occur when deleting a Note, and these have been corrected. </p>
<h4 id="added-limited-ability-to-import-email-messages">4. Added Limited Ability to Import Email Messages</h4>
<p>You can now drag and drop an email message onto the list view of a Collection, however the email parsing abilities are very minimal at this time, so results will vary considerably. </p>
<h4 id="added-ability-to-import-vcards">5. Added Ability to Import VCards</h4>
<p>Added some very rudimentary ability to import VCards by dragging contacts from the Apple Contacts app onto the list view of a Collection. </p>

<h2>2020 May 12 &mdash; macOS version 3.7.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="new-template-option-to-specify-field-values-to-pick-from">1. New Template Option to specify Field values to Pick From</h4>
<p>In a template file, users can now specify a series of &#8216;pick-from&#8217; values for a field. </p>
<h4 id="double-clicking-in-the-list-view-now-launches-the-notes-link">2. Double-Clicking in the List View now launches the Note's Link</h4>
<p>Double-clicking on a Note from the List tab will now attempt to launch whatever Link the Note may have. </p>
<h4 id="added-command-to-discard-edits">3. Added Command to Discard Edits</h4>
<p>Beneath the Note menu the user can now find a command (with suitable shortcut) to discard the edits that are currently in work. This can be used to do away with an attempt to add a new Note, or with in-progress changes to an existing Note. </p>
<h4 id="notenik-icloud-container">4. Notenik iCloud Container</h4>
<p>Notenik now has its own iCloud Container, and the Collections Board (originally the Bookmarks Board) has been reconfigured a bit to make special use of it. </p>

<h2>2020 May 06 &mdash; macOS version 3.6.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="added-new-note-sharing-format-of-markdown-quote">1. Added new Note Sharing Format of Markdown Quote</h4>
<p>The body of the selected Note will have Markdown blockquoting applied to it. This can be accessed from the Share item beneath the Note menu. </p>
<h4 id="bookmarks-retention-now-attempted">2. Bookmarks Retention Now Attempted</h4>
<p>There are a couple of new commands beneath the File menu. The <code>Bookmarks Board</code> command will open up a window showing folders that have been remembered from previous sessions, and will show these in a hierarchical tree view. At a minimum, this window will show the same folders listed unter the <code>Open Recent</code> menu. The second, related, new command, <code>Load Bookmarks</code>, will attempt to load additional folder references that have been stored in the User Defaults as Security-Scoped Bookmarks. If none of this makes any sense, or seems to offer anything useful, then it can safely be ignored. </p>
<h4 id="drag-and-drop-from-one-collection-to-another">3. Drag and Drop from One Collection to Another</h4>
<p>When two Collections are open, the user may now drag a Note from the List view of one Collection to the List view of a second Collection and Drop it there. The Note will be added to the second Collection, and will still remain in its original Collection. Any fields present in the first Collection but not defined in the second will be dropped. </p>
<h4 id="bug-fixed-when-pasting-or-dragging-a-note-with-dissimilar-fields">4. Bug Fixed When Pasting or Dragging a Note with Dissimilar Fields</h4>
<p>When pasting a copied Note into a Collection, if the Note to be copied had fields not already in the target Collection, then the paste would fail and the app would crash. </p>
<p>Dragging and dropping a Note from one Collection to another would cause a similar situation. </p>
<p>This has been fixed so that additional fields not present in the target Collection will be ignored. </p>
<h4 id="improved-apostrophe-handling">5. Improved Apostrophe Handling</h4>
<p>An apostrophe appearing in the middle of a word, or at the beginning of a word, is no longer treated as if it might be a closing single quote mark. </p>

<p>Added a new Sort option to allow sorting by the Tags field, plus Title. </p>
<h4 id="added-new-note-shortcuts-for-status-updates">4. Added New Note Shortcuts for Status Updates</h4>
<p>See these new commands beneath the Note menu: </p>
<ul>
<li>Toggle Status - Switches from least complete to most, and back again. </li>
<li>Increment Status - Bump to the next stage in the Collection's lifecycle. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are keyboard shortcuts available for both of these. </p>
<p>Note that these are designed to be used in Display mode, not in Edit mode. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 Mar 29 &mdash; macOS version 3.3.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="modified-duplicate-handling">1. Modified Duplicate Handling</h4>
<p>Changed the handling of duplicates so that Notenik will automatically add a numeric suffix, or increment one if already present, in order to allow a Note to be added that would otherwise be a duplicate. </p>
<h4 id="fixed-html-block-parsing-for-comments">2. Fixed HTML Block parsing for Comments</h4>
<p>Updated the new internal Markdown parser to recognize HTML comments. </p>
<h4 id="fixed-blockquote-parsing-bug">3. Fixed Blockquote Parsing Bug</h4>
<p>When a blockquote was continued to a second paragraph, the second paragraph ended up being a blockquote within a blockquote. This has now been fixed. </p>

<p>The target version for macOS is now 10.13. It was previously set to 10.14. Early reports indicates it works just fine on the earlier version of macOS. </p>
<h4 id="bug-fixes-for-3.2.0">2. Bug Fixes for 3.2.0</h4>
<p>The following bugs were fixed in this release. </p>
<ul>
<li>The sharing function now respects a request to share the body only in HTML; previously, the entire Note was shared, disregarding the user's selection. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="third-markdown-parser-added">3. Third Markdown Parser Added</h4>
<p>Notenik now has its own internal Markdown parser. I tried to implement pretty much everything in the original <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">SmartyPants</a> specs from John Gruber. The other two parsers are still available as options, but the Notenik parser is now the default, since it is now the only way to add links between Notes. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 Feb 21 &mdash; macOS version 3.1.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="added-t-to-mark-tasks-with-todays-date">1. Added T to mark Tasks with Today's Date</h4>
<p>In the List view, when sorting tasks, the first column contains an &#8216;X&#8217; to mark items that have been completed. In addition, any tasks bearing today's date (and not yet completed) will now additionally show a &#8216;T&#8217; in this same column. </p>

<h2>2020 Jan 29 &mdash; Using Notenik with Existing Text Files</h2>

<p>Since Notenik is rather late to the game of managing text files, and since those already using similar sorts of files are probably among those interested in my app, I wanted to talk a bit about how the latest version of Notenik can be used with existing folders full of text files. </p>

<hr />
<h2>2020 Jan 22 &mdash; macOS version 2.9.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="enabled-the-preferred-file-extension-to-be-changed">1. Enabled the Preferred File Extension to be Changed</h4>
<p>The Collection Preferences window is shown when creating a new Collection, but can also be accessed after a Collection has been created. Previously, changing the preferred file extension after initial creation had no effect, but the file extension for the template file will now be changed to reflect the new preferred extension. Notes already created, however, will retain their existing extensions. This should close Issue # 31. </p>
<h4 id="collection-preferences-window-redesigned">2. Collection Preferences Window Redesigned</h4>
<p>The new Collection Preferences design now has two tabs, one for a scrollable list of fields, and the other for various other Collection Attributes. OK and Cancel buttons are positioned at the bottom of the window, outside of the tabs. A new file path has been added at the very bottom of the window, showing the file system path to the Collection whose preferences are being modified. This should close Issue # 30. </p>
<h4 id="various-performance-improvements">3. Various Performance Improvements</h4>
<p>Made various changes intended to improve performance, especially when opening large collections. See Issue # 28. </p>
<h4 id="changes-to-collection-preferences-menu">4. Changes to Collection Preferences Menu</h4>
<p>Added ellipsis to menu item to indicate that a new window will open before any action occurs. See Issue # 29. Also added a keyboard shortcut of CMD-; (Command semicolon). </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 Jan 14 &mdash; macOS version 2.8.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="made-collection-preferences-scrollable">1. Made Collection Preferences Scrollable</h4>
<p>Added vertical scrolling to the Collection Prefs window, to make sure all content is always accessible. This resolves Issue # 14. </p>
<h4 id="edit-view-now-scrollable">2. Edit View Now Scrollable</h4>
<p>The entire Edit view is now scrollable, to ensure all fields are accessible, no matter what size the screen or window, and no matter how many fields a Collection has. This resolves Issue # 13. </p>
<h4 id="improved-display-refresh-after-updates-to-font-prefs">3. Improved Display Refresh after Updates to Font Prefs</h4>
<p>After updating the font info in the Display Prefs, all current Display panels should now be refreshed immediately to reflect the new choices. </p>
<h4 id="decreased-tolerance-for-special-characters-in-field-labels">4. Decreased Tolerance for Special Characters in Field Labels</h4>
<p>In order to avoid excessive identification of metadata, most special characters (other than hyphens and underscores) will now disqualify a text string preceding a colon from being treated as a field label. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 Jan 10 &mdash; macOS version 2.7.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="improved-multimarkdown-metadata-support">1. Improved MultiMarkdown Metadata Support</h4>
<p>Improved support for opening existing files using MultiMarkdown Metadata; in particular, now looking for triple-dash lines before and after the metadata, and treating those lines appropriately. A line with four periods is also accepted following the metadata. </p>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">2. Bug Fixes</h4>
<p>Fixed a few bugs. </p>
<h4 id="added-notenik-export">3. Added Notenik Export</h4>
<p>Added an option to export a Collection to a new Notenik Collection; this is intended to be especially useful when opening an existing folder full of text files, not necessarily in the usual Notenik file format, and then exporting them to a new Collection in which the Notenik format is fully normalized. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2020 Jan 10 &mdash; The Thinking Behind the Notenik File Format</h2>

<p>People have been storing notes in text files long before Notenik came along. So why is the Notenik format different? </p>

<h4 id="applied-postels-law-to-note-formats">1. Applied Postel's Law to Note Formats</h4>
<p>Notenik is now more liberal in terms of accepting Notes in a wider variety of formats. Plain text notes, Multi-Markdown notes, and Markdown notes will now be accepted, in addition to the defined Notenik format. </p>
<h4 id="applied-postels-law-to-date-formats">2. Applied Postel's Law to Date Formats</h4>
<p>Notenik is now more liberal in terms of the sorts of dates it will parse correctly. Specifically, an 8-digit yyyymmdd date, without any punctuation, should now be correctly parsed. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2019 Dec 29 &mdash; macOS version 2.5.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="fixed-a-few-other-bugs">1. Fixed a few other bugs</h4>
<p>A few more code improvements. </p>

<p>Corrected a bug that could sometimes cause a legitimate note to be misidentified as the collection's info file. </p>
<h4 id="added-json-export-and-sharing">3. Added JSON Export and Sharing</h4>
<p>A note can now be shared in JSON format, and a collection can be exported in JSON. </p>
<h4 id="enabled-spelling-checker-on-body-text">4. Enabled Spelling Checker on Body text</h4>
<p>Spelling will now be checked in the Body field. </p>
<h4 id="added-reload-note-command">5. Added Reload Note Command</h4>

<h2>2019 Dec 13 &mdash; macOS version 2.4.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="added-startup-check">1. Added Startup Check</h4>
<p>Added a logic check to see if the app completed a successful launch the last time it was run. If not, then the application resets the user preferences to avoid a recurring crash. </p>
<h4 id="added-note-to-note-linking">2. Added Note-to-Note Linking</h4>
<p>Wiki-style links between Notes within a Collection are now supported. Several related pieces of functionality work together to enable this capability. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Collection Preferences pane now includes a checkbox for &#8220;Double Bracket Parsing for Inter-Note Links&#8221;. Turning this option on for a particular Collection allows the user to begin adding links between Notes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once this option is enabled, the body of a Note may include a link to another Note by enclosing the title of that other Note within double square brackets. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new Variable Modifier of &#8216;W&#8217; available in Merge Templates allows these inter-note pointers to be converted to usable links when generating HTML. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>2019 Dec 10 &mdash; macOS version 2.3.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="fixed-treatment-of-teaser-field">1. Fixed Treatment of Teaser Field</h4>
<p>Modified to treat the Teaser field as longtext. </p>
<h4 id="increased-tolerance-for-notes-with-alternative-formatting">2. Increased Tolerance for Notes with Alternative Formatting</h4>
<p>Some note-takers start their text files with lines such as the following. </p>
<pre>
<code># Note Title
#tag
Body starts here. 
</code></pre>
<p>Notenik will now recognize the first line of such a file as containing the Note's title, and will recognize the second line as containing a tag for the Note. </p>
<p>Also, bracket characters and parentheses preceding a colon will now indicate to Notenik that such text should not be treated as a field label. </p>
<h4 id="added-timestamp-field">3. Added Timestamp Field</h4>
<p>A Timestamp field can be used to generate a timestamp for each note, in a &#8220;yyyyMMddkkmmss&#8221; format, consisting of: </p>
<ul>
<li>4-digit year </li>
<li>2-digit month </li>
<li>2-digit day of month </li>
<li>hour of day, using a 24-hour range </li>
<li>minute of hour </li>
<li>second of minute </li>

<h4 id="eliminated-option-to-generate-sample-reports-for-help-notes">2. Eliminated Option to Generate Sample Reports for Help Notes</h4>
<p>App Store testers correctly pointed out that selecting this option for the Help Notes would cause a crash. </p>
<h4 id="suppressed-empty-tags-from-favorites-to-html-export">3. Suppressed Empty Tags from Favorites to HTML Export</h4>
<p>You can sometimes end up with empty tags in a collection, as a result of deleting notes or changing tags. Previously these would be included when creating a Favorites page, but they are now suppressed. </p>
<h4 id="moved-reload-collection-command-from-file-menu-to-collection-menu">4. Moved Reload Collection Command from File Menu to Collection Menu</h4>
<p>The Reload Collection command will hopefully be easier to find beneath the Collection menu. </p>

<p>Based on feedback from a user in Australia, added support for the British spelling of &#8216;Favourites&#8217;. </p>
<h4 id="added-cut-copy-and-paste-support-for-notes">6. Added Cut, Copy and Paste Support for Notes</h4>
<p>The Cut, Copy and Paste commands — along with their corresponding keyboard shortcuts — are now enabled on the Edit menu for Notes. After selecting a Note, the Cut or Copy commands may be used to cut/copy the entire note. The note is copied to the clipboard as text, so that it can then be pasted into any application where text is accepted — including, but not limited to, Notenik itself. Be aware that the user should be on the Display Tab, and not the Edit tab, in order to perform these note-based functions since, when on the Edit tab, cut/copy/paste will typically apply to the text within a field, and not to the entire note. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2019 Dec 03 &mdash; Notenik for the Mac Version 2.2.0 Released</h2>

<h4 id="folder-open-thru-finder-drag-and-drop-enabled">1. Folder Open thru Finder Drag-and-Drop Enabled</h4>
<p>Folder(s) may now be opened by dragging them onto the Notenik icon in the Finder. Notenik will respond in one of four ways to each Finder item. </p>
<ul>
<li>If a folder contains an existing Notenik Collection, then that Collection will be opened in a new window. </li>
<li>If a folder is empty, then it will be initialized as a new Notenik Collection, and opened in a new window. </li>
<li>if the dragged item is not a folder at all, then an error message will be displayed. </li>
<li>Any other folder will be treated as a parent realm, and the resulting window will show Collections and Scripts found within that realm. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed-deployment-target-back-to-10.14-to-allow-operation-on-mojave">2. Changed Deployment Target Back to 10.14 to Allow Operation on Mojave</h4>

<ul>
<li>Generate Report Sample in HTML </li>
<li>Generate Report Sample in Markdown </li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting one of these will then cause Notenik to create a reports folder for the collection, if one does not already exist, and then to create a report template containing all of the Collection's fields in a basic layout. The user may then modify this template in order to further customize the output formatting. </p>

<h2>2019 Oct 24 &mdash; Notenik: A Contrarian Mix of Old and New</h2>

<p>Given my background as a programmer and long-time Mac user, it should probably come as no surprise that my first native Mac app is a sometimes surprising mix of old and new. </p>

<h2>2019 Oct 15 &mdash; macOS version 1.6.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="various-minor-tweaks">1. Various Minor Tweaks</h4>
<p>Made a number of tweaks to fix bugs and/or improve operation. </p>
<h4 id="textile-parser-added">2. Textile Parser Added</h4>
<p>A homegrown &#8220;good enough&#8221; Textile Parser has been added to Notenik. It can be invoked by including a file with a &#8216;.textile&#8217; file extension when generating HTML output. </p>
<h4 id="template-include-file-conversion-honored">3. Template Include File Conversion Honored</h4>
<p>When using the Include command within a Scripting Template file to include another file, automatic conversion will now be done when the included file extension differs from the output file extension. In particular, Markdown and Textile documents will be converted to HTML, when appropriate. Note that the Textile parser used is one internal to Notenik, and is at best a &#8220;good enough&#8221; tool, but one that is far from comprehensive. </p>
<h4 id="seq-field-prefix-now-honored">4. Seq Field Prefix Now Honored</h4>
<p>Field names beginning with &#8220;Seq&#8221; will now be treated as Seq fields for the purpose of sorting when using the Scripting Engine. This will cause numeric fields, for example, to sort into their proper numeric sequence, instead of treating them as alphanumeric fields. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2019 Oct 01 &mdash; All Swift, All the Time</h2>

<p>Moving on from Java, Notenik development is now all Swift, all the time. </p>

<h2>2019 Sep 20 &mdash; macOS version 1.5.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="enhanced-logic-for-incrementing-the-seq-field">1. Enhanced Logic for Incrementing the Seq Field</h4>
<p>Made some improvements in the logic for incrementing the Seq field to properly increment following Notes to prevent overlap. </p>
<h4 id="additional-refinements">2. Additional Refinements</h4>
<p>Fixed a bug that sometimes caused newline characters to be ignored when trying to load a Note from disk. </p>
<h4 id="added-a-dash-as-a-new-variable-modifier">3. Added a Dash as a New Variable Modifier</h4>
<p>A dash may now optionally follow the letter O, which will result in the html string produced by the Markdown conversion having opening and closing paragraph tags stripped from the resulting string. </p>
<h4 id="added-special-treatment-for-artist-field">4. Added Special Treatment for Artist Field</h4>
<p>A field name of Artist will now be used as an alternate to Author when sorting by Author. A leading &#8216;The&#8217; will be ignored, and values will be sorted as if they were all lower case. </p>
<h4 id="added-longtext-option-to-template-file">5. Added <longtext> option to Template file</h4>
<p>By specifying the value <longtext> as the value for a field in a template file, the user can now indicate that a field is to be a long text field, rather than a one-line text field. </p>


<hr />
<h2>2019 Sep 08 &mdash; macOS version 1.4.1 released</h2>

<h4 id="added-checks-before-completing-save-as">1. Added Checks Before Completing Save As</h4>
<p>The Save As command relies on the user creating a new folder to receive the copied contents of the current Collection. It then deletes the folder in order to take advantage of a native macOS command to copy the existing folder to the new location. However, this logic would allow the user to select an existing folder, containing other contents, and would then delete it. Notenik has been modified to make sure that the requested recipient of a Save As command is actually empty, before copying the old Collection to that (presumed new) location. The program is also now making an additional check to ensure the user doesn't try to make his entire Desktop folder a Notenik Collection (even if it is empty). </p>


<hr />
<h2>2019 Sep 03 &mdash; macOS version 1.4.0 released</h2>

<h4 id="work-type-now-uses-a-combo-box">1. Work Type now uses a Combo Box</h4>
<p>When a Collection (typically, of quotations) has a &#8216;Work Type&#8217; field, then Notenik will now present a standard, selectable list of options to choose from using what is known as a &#8220;Combo Box&#8221; control for editing. </p>
<h4 id="improved-collection-load-speed">2. Improved Collection Load Speed</h4>
<p>Improved the speed of opening a new Collection by optimizing the sorting of Notes as they are loaded into memory. </p>
<h4 id="miscellaneous-improvements">3. Miscellaneous Improvements</h4>
<p>A few minor bug fixes and minor improvements. </p>
<h4 id="added-script-file-recording">4. Added Script File Recording</h4>
<p>Notenik can now be used to record script files, as well as play them back. </p>

<p>Users can now pick from previously identified tags when entering a new one. </p>
<h4 id="bug-fixes-and-improvements">2. Bug Fixes and Improvements</h4>
<p>Markdown conversion now renders embedded HTML and does a smart typographic conversion. </p>
<p>Occasional problem with erroneous blanks in the ‘X’ column (indicating done or not) is now fixed. </p>
<h4 id="added-standardize-dates-to-ymd-to-the-collection-menu">3. Added Standardize Dates to YMD to the Collection Menu</h4>
<p>Execution of this command will change all the dates in all the Notes for the current Collection so that they are stored in yyyy-mm-dd format, which can be useful to ensure than an export file sorts correctly on date. </p>
<h4 id="added-split-tags-export-to-the-file-menu">4. Added Split Tags Export to the File Menu</h4>
<p>The Split Tags command under the File menu will split the tags for each Note, and write one output row for each Tag for each Note. Notes without tags will be written out only once; Notes with multiple tags will be written out once for each Tag. In addition to the Tags column, a Tag (singular) column will be added to the front of each row, containing one particular Tag for the Note. This export file can be used, for example, to create an index page for each Tag. </p>
