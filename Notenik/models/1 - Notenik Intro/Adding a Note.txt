Body: 

To add a new Note, click on the `+` (plus sign) in the toolbar, or select `New Note` beneath the `Note` menu. 

You will then be taken to the `Edit` tab, where you can enter the Title of the new Note, along with other fields. 

Each Note in a Collection must have its own unique Title, so be sure and enter something that will differentiate your new Note from other Notes in the same Collection.
