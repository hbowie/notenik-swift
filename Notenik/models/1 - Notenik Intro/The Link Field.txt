Title:  The Link Field

Seq:    12

Body: 

I've already talked about the ability to use Markdown within the body of a Note to embed hyperlinks. 

But you can also enter a URL (aka a *Web Link*) into a special Link field. 

If you have entered a link in this way -- in its own field -- then double-clicking on a Note's row within the `List` tab will cause the link to be opened within your Web browser. 

You can also use the `Launch Link` button on the toolbar to open a link in this way. 

And you can also use the `Launch Link` command beneath the `Note` menu to open the Web address entered into a Link field. 

In all of these cases, the link will be opened in your Web browser, and not within Notenik itself.
