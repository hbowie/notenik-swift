This brief into is designed to be both a tutorial and a workshop for learning some of the Notenik basics. That is, this intro is itself a Notenik Collection containing instructions on the use of Notenik; but it is a disposable copy that you can modify however you would like, so all of the editing capabilites of Notenik will be available to you as you step through the tutorial.  

When you install and launch Notenik for the first time, this intro will typically be the first thing you see. 

(You can also find a read-only copy of this intro on the [Notenik.app website](https://notenik.app/intro/EPUB/html/welcome-to-notenik.html).)
