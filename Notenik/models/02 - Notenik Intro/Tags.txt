Body: 

Notenik allows you to assign one or more tags to each Note, and each tag may have one or more levels. 

You assign tags to a Note by typing them into the Tags field on the Edit tab. 

Once you have entered tags, then you can use the `Tags` tab -- on the left, next to the `List` tab -- to see your Notes organized by tag. 

Click on a disclosure triangle to show lower-level tags, or the Notes having a given tag. 

Click on a Note's title within the `Tags` tab to see the content of the Note appear on the right.
