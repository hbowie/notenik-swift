Body: 

To create a New Collection, select `New Collection...` beneath the `File` menu. 

You will then be walked through a series of screens. 

+ The first screen will ask you to specify the general **Location** of your new Collection. 

	+ If you are signed into iCloud, then you can select `The Notenik folder within iCloud Drive`, which is generally the easiest option. 

	+ Otherwise you can select `A location of your choosing`, which will allow you to locate your new Collection folder anywhere you like within your file system (in your `Documents` folder, for example). If you choose this option, you will then see a standard macOS Open dialog, allowing you to choose the parent folder in which your new Collection will be created. 

+ Next you'll be prompted for the **Name** of your new Collection. This will become the name of the folder in which your Notes will be stored. 

+ Then you'll be able to choose the set of **Fields** that will be available within your Collection. You'll be able to select a general type of Collection, and each type will have a set of associated fields. 

+ At this point, your new Collection will be created, and you will be presented with the Collection Preferences screen. You can use this screen to add or remove fields, and/or modify the other Collection settings. 

Once you hit the `OK` button, your new Collection will be ready for use.
