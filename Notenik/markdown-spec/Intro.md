Body: 

This Collection contains the specifications for the Notenik Markdown parser. The bulk of this is made up of text taken from John Gruber's [original Markdown Syntax definition](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Where support for [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) has been added, the source for that text is noted.
