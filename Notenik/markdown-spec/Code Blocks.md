Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or
markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines
of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block
in both `<pre>` and `<code>` tags.

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the
block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:

    This is a normal paragraph:

        This is a code block.

Markdown will generate:

    <p>This is a normal paragraph:</p>

    <pre><code>This is a code block.
    </code></pre>

One level of indentation -- 4 spaces or 1 tab -- is removed from each
line of the code block. For example, this:

    Here is an example of AppleScript:

        tell application "Foo"
            beep
        end tell

will turn into:

    <p>Here is an example of AppleScript:</p>

    <pre><code>tell application "Foo"
        beep
    end tell
    </code></pre>

A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented
(or the end of the article).

Within a code block, ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` and `>`)
are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very
easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown -- just paste
it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the
ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:

        <div class="footer">
            &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
        </div>

will turn into:

    <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
        &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,
asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means
it's also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown's own syntax.
