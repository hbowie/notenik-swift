Title:  Line Breaks

Tags:   line breaks

Status: 9 - Tested

Seq:    2.1.2

Body: 

When you *do* want to insert a `<br />` break tag using Markdown, you
end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.

Yes, this takes a tad more effort to create a `<br />`, but a simplistic
"every line break is a `<br />`" rule wouldn't work for Markdown.
Markdown's email-style [[blockquotes]] and multi-paragraph items within [[lists]]
work best -- and look better -- when you format them with hard breaks.
